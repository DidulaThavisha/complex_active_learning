The total income of mr. Funt during this year is equal to *n* (*n*<=\u2265<=2) burles and the amount of tax he has to pay is calculated as the maximum divisor of *n* (not equal to *n*, of course). For example, if *n*<==<=6 then Funt has to pay 3 burles, while for *n*<==<=25 he needs to pay 5 and if *n*<==<=2 he pays only 1 burle.\n\nAs mr. Funt is a very opportunistic person he wants to cheat a bit. In particular, he wants to split the initial *n* in several parts *n*1<=+<=*n*2<=+<=...<=+<=*n**k*<==<=*n* (here *k* is arbitrary, even *k*<==<=1 is allowed) and pay the taxes for each part separately. He can't make some part equal to 1 because it will reveal him. So, the condition *n**i*<=\u2265<=2 should hold for all *i* from 1 to *k*.\n\nOstap Bender wonders, how many money Funt has to pay (i.e. minimal) if he chooses and optimal way to split *n* in parts.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7109)\u00a0\u2014 the total year income of mr.

        "prompt": "Title: Mike and Shortcuts\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nRecently, Mike was very busy with studying for exams and contests. Now he is going to chill a bit by doing some sight seeing in the city.\n\nCity consists of *n* intersections numbered from 1 to *n*. Mike starts walking from his house located at the intersection number 1 and goes along some sequence of intersections. Walking from intersection number *i* to intersection *j* requires |*i*<=-<=*j*| units of energy. The total energy spent by Mike to visit a sequence of intersections *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k* is equal to  units of energy.\n\nOf course, walking would be boring if there were no shortcuts. A shortcut is a special path that allows Mike walking from one intersection to another requiring only 1 unit of energy. There are exactly *n* shortcuts in Mike's city, the *i**th* of them allows walking from intersection *i* to intersection *a**i* (*i*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=+<=1) (but not in the opposite direction), thus there is exactly one shortcut starting at each intersection. Formally, if Mike chooses a sequence *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k* then for each 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*k* satisfying *p**i*<=+<=1<==<=*a**p**i* and *a**p**i*<=\u2260<=*p**i* Mike will spend only 1 unit of energy instead of |*p**i*<=-<=*p**i*<=+<=1| walking from the intersection *p**i* to intersection *p**i*<=+<=1. For example, if Mike chooses a sequence *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2<==<=*a**p*1,<=*p*3<==<=*a**p*2,<=...,<=*p**k*<==<=*a**p**k*<=-<=1, he spends exactly *k*<=-<=1 units of total energy walking around them.\n\nBefore going on his adventure, Mike asks you to find the minimum amount of energy required to reach each of the intersections from his home. Formally, for each 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n* Mike is interested in finding minimum possible total energy of some sequence *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k*<==<=*i*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of Mike's city intersection.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (*i*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n* , , describing shortcuts of Mike's city, allowing to walk from intersection *i* to intersection *a**i* using only 1 unit of energy. Please note that the shortcuts don't allow walking in opposite directions (from *a**i* to *i*).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the only line print *n* integers *m*1,<=*m*2,<=...,<=*m**n*, where *m**i* denotes the least amount of total energy required to walk from intersection 1 to intersection *i*.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n2 2 3\\n', '5\\n1 2 3 4 5\\n', '7\\n4 4 4 4 7 7 7\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0 1 2 \\n', '0 1 2 3 4 \\n', '0 1 2 1 2 3 3 \\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample case desired sequences are:\n\n1:\u20091; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>\u2009=\u20090;\n\n2:\u20091,\u20092; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009=\u20091;\n\n3:\u20091,\u20093; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">3</sub>\u2009=\u2009|3\u2009-\u20091|\u2009=\u20092.\n\nIn the second sample case the sequence for any intersection 1\u2009&lt;\u2009*i* is always 1,\u2009*i* and *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub>\u2009=\u2009|1\u2009-\u2009*i*|.\n\nIn the third sample case\u00a0\u2014 consider the following intersection sequences:\n\n1:\u20091; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>\u2009=\u20090;\n\n2:\u20091,\u20092; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009=\u2009|2\u2009-\u20091|\u2009=\u20091;\n\n3:\u20091,\u20094,\u20093; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">3</sub>\u2009=\u20091\u2009+\u2009|4\u2009-\u20093|\u2009=\u20092;\n\n4:\u20091,\u20094; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">4</sub>\u2009=\u20091;\n\n5:\u20091,\u20094,\u20095; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">5</sub>\u2009=\u20091\u2009+\u2009|4\u2009-\u20095|\u2009=\u20092;\n\n6:\u20091,\u20094,\u20096; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">6</sub>\u2009=\u20091\u2009+\u2009|4\u2009-\u20096|\u2009=\u20093;\n\n7:\u20091,\u20094,\u20095,\u20097; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">7</sub>\u2009=\u20091\u2009+\u2009|4\u2009-\u20095|\u2009+\u20091\u2009=\u20093.",

And even more he likes them, when they are identical. That's why in his spare time Valera plays the following game. He takes any two strings, consisting of lower case Latin letters, and tries to make them identical. According to the game rules, with each move Valera can change one arbitrary character *A**i* in one of the strings into arbitrary character *B**i*, but he has to pay for every move a particular sum of money, equal to *W**i*. He is allowed to make as many moves as he needs. Since Valera is a very economical boy and never wastes his money, he asked you, an experienced programmer, to help him answer the question: what minimum amount of money should Valera have to get identical strings.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains two initial non-empty strings *s* and *t*, consisting of lower case Latin letters.

Then follow *n* lines, each containing characters *A**i* and *B**i* (lower case Latin letters) and integer *W**i* (0<=\u2264<=*W**i*<=\u2264<=100), saying that it's allowed to change character *A**i* into character *B**i* in any of the strings and spend sum of money *W**i*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf the answer exists, output the answer to the problem, and the resulting string.

        "prompt": "Title: Sets\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nLittle Vasya likes very much to play with sets consisting of positive integers. To make the game more interesting, Vasya chose *n* non-empty sets in such a way, that no two of them have common elements.\n\nOne day he wanted to show his friends just how interesting playing with numbers is. For that he wrote out all possible unions of two different sets on *n*\u00b7(*n*<=-<=1)<=/<=2 pieces of paper. Then he shuffled the pieces of paper. He had written out the numbers in the unions in an arbitrary order.\n\nFor example, if *n*<==<=4, and the actual sets have the following form {1,<=3}, {5}, {2,<=4}, {7}, then the number of set pairs equals to six. The six pieces of paper can contain the following numbers: \n -  2,<=7,<=4. -  1,<=7,<=3; -  5,<=4,<=2; -  1,<=3,<=5; -  3,<=1,<=2,<=4; -  5,<=7. \nThen Vasya showed the pieces of paper to his friends, but kept the *n* sets secret from them. His friends managed to calculate which sets Vasya had thought of in the first place. And how about you, can you restore the sets by the given pieces of paper?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input file line contains a number *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200), *n* is the number of sets at Vasya's disposal. Then follow sets of numbers from the pieces of paper written on *n*\u00b7(*n*<=-<=1)<=/<=2 lines. Each set starts with the number *k**i* (2<=\u2264<=*k**i*<=\u2264<=200), which is the number of numbers written of the *i*-th piece of paper, and then follow *k**i* numbers *a**ij* (1<=\u2264<=*a**ij*<=\u2264<=200). All the numbers on the lines are separated by exactly one space. It is guaranteed that the input data is constructed according to the above given rules from *n* non-intersecting sets.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint on *n* lines Vasya's sets' description. The first number on the line shows how many numbers the current set has. Then the set should be recorded by listing its elements. Separate the numbers by spaces. Each number and each set should be printed exactly once. Print the sets and the numbers in the sets in any order.

        "prompt": "Title: Bombs\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nYou've got a robot, its task is destroying bombs on a square plane. Specifically, the square plane contains *n* bombs, the *i*-th bomb is at point with coordinates (*x**i*,<=*y**i*). We know that no two bombs are at the same point and that no bomb is at point with coordinates (0,<=0). Initially, the robot is at point with coordinates (0,<=0). Also, let's mark the robot's current position as (*x*,<=*y*). In order to destroy all the bombs, the robot can perform three types of operations:\n 1.  Operation has format \"1 k dir\". To perform the operation robot have to move in direction *dir* *k* (*k*<=\u2265<=1) times. There are only 4 directions the robot can move in: \"R\", \"L\", \"U\", \"D\". During one move the robot can move from the current point to one of following points: (*x*<=+<=1,<=*y*), (*x*<=-<=1,<=*y*), (*x*,<=*y*<=+<=1), (*x*,<=*y*<=-<=1) (corresponding to directions). It is forbidden to move from point (*x*,<=*y*), if at least one point on the path (besides the destination point) contains a bomb. 1.  Operation has format \"2\". To perform the operation robot have to pick a bomb at point (*x*,<=*y*) and put it in a special container. Thus, the robot can carry the bomb from any point to any other point. The operation cannot be performed if point (*x*,<=*y*) has no bomb. It is forbidden to pick a bomb if the robot already has a bomb in its container. 1.  Operation has format \"3\". To perform the operation robot have to take a bomb out of the container and destroy it. You are allowed to perform this operation only if the robot is at point (0,<=0). It is forbidden to perform the operation if the container has no bomb. \nHelp the robot and find the shortest possible sequence of operations he can perform to destroy all bombs on the coordinate plane.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of bombs on the coordinate plane. Next *n* lines contain two integers each. The *i*-th line contains numbers (*x**i*,<=*y**i*) (<=-<=109<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the coordinates of the *i*-th bomb. It is guaranteed that no two bombs are located at the same point and no bomb is at point (0,<=0).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn a single line print a single integer *k* \u2014 the minimum number of operations needed to destroy all bombs. On the next lines print the descriptions of these *k* operations. If there are multiple sequences, you can print any of them. It is guaranteed that there is the solution where *k*<=\u2264<=106.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2\\n1 1\\n-1 -1\\n', '3\\n5 0\\n0 5\\n1 0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['12\\n1 1 R\\n1 1 U\\n2\\n1 1 L\\n1 1 D\\n3\\n1 1 L\\n1 1 D\\n2\\n1 1 R\\n1 1 U\\n3\\n', '12\\n1 1 R\\n2\\n1 1 L\\n3\\n1 5 R\\n2\\n1 5 L\\n3\\n1 5 U\\n2\\n1 5 D\\n3\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

There are *m* flamingos in the Zoo, located at points with positive coordinates. The flamingos are currently sleeping and you can assume that they don't move.\n\nIn order to get a good view over the flamingos, each of the binoculars can be independently rotated to face any angle (not necessarily integer).

        "prompt": "Title: Brand New Easy Problem\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nA widely known among some people Belarusian sport programmer Lesha decided to make some money to buy a one square meter larger flat. To do this, he wants to make and carry out a Super Rated Match (SRM) on the site Torcoder.com. But there's a problem \u2014 a severe torcoder coordinator Ivan does not accept any Lesha's problem, calling each of them an offensive word \"duped\" (that is, duplicated). And one day they nearely quarrelled over yet another problem Ivan wouldn't accept.\n\nYou are invited to act as a fair judge and determine whether the problem is indeed brand new, or Ivan is right and the problem bears some resemblance to those used in the previous SRMs.\n\nYou are given the descriptions of Lesha's problem and each of Torcoder.com archive problems. The description of each problem is a sequence of words. Besides, it is guaranteed that Lesha's problem has no repeated words, while the description of an archive problem may contain any number of repeated words.\n\nThe \"similarity\" between Lesha's problem and some archive problem can be found as follows. Among all permutations of words in Lesha's problem we choose the one that occurs in the archive problem as a subsequence. If there are multiple such permutations, we choose the one with the smallest number of inversions. Then the \"similarity\" of a problem can be written as , where *n* is the number of words in Lesha's problem and *x* is the number of inversions in the chosen permutation. Note that the \"similarity\" *p* is always a positive integer.\n\nThe problem is called brand new if there is not a single problem in Ivan's archive which contains a permutation of words from Lesha's problem as a subsequence.\n\nHelp the boys and determine whether the proposed problem is new, or specify the problem from the archive which resembles Lesha's problem the most, otherwise.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=4) \u2014 the number of words in Lesha's problem. The second line contains *n* space-separated words \u2014 the short description of the problem.\n\nThe third line contains a single integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=10) \u2014 the number of problems in the Torcoder.com archive. Next *m* lines contain the descriptions of the problems as \"*k* *s*1 *s*2 ... *s**k*\", where *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=20) is the number of words in the problem and *s**i* is a word of the problem description.\n\nAll words from all problem descriptions contain no more than 10 lowercase English letters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf Lesha's problem is brand new, print string \"Brand new problem!\" (without quotes). \n\nOtherwise, on the first line print the index of the archive problem which resembles Lesha's problem most. If there are multiple such problems, print the one with the smallest index. On the second line print a string consisting of characters [:, character | repeated *p* times, and characters :], where *p* is the \"similarity\" between this problem and Lesha's one. The archive problems are numbered starting from one in the order in which they are given in the input.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\nfind the next palindrome\\n1\\n10 find the previous palindrome or print better luck next time\\n', '3\\nadd two numbers\\n3\\n1 add\\n2 two two\\n3 numbers numbers numbers\\n', '4\\nthese papers are formulas\\n3\\n6 what are these formulas and papers\\n5 papers are driving me crazy\\n4 crazy into the night\\n', '3\\nadd two decimals\\n5\\n4 please two decimals add\\n5 decimals want to be added\\n4 two add decimals add\\n4 add one two three\\n7 one plus two plus three equals six\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n[:||||||:]\\n', 'Brand new problem!\\n', '1\\n[:||||:]\\n', '3\\n[:|||:]\\n']\n\nNote:\nLet us remind you that the number of inversions is the number of pairs of words that follow in the permutation not in their original order. Thus, for example, if the original problem is \"add two numbers\", then permutation \"numbers add two\" contains two inversions \u2014 pairs of words \"numbers\" and \"add\", \"numbers\" and \"two\". \n\nSequence *b*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>,\u2009\u2009*b*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>,\u2009\u2009...,\u2009\u2009*b*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*k*</sub> is a subsequence of sequence *a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>,\u2009*a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>,\u2009\u2009...,\u2009\u2009*a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*n*</sub> if there exists such a set of indices 1\u2009\u2264\u2009*i*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>\u2009&lt;\u2009\u2009*i*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009&lt;\u2009... \u2009\u2009&lt;\u2009*i*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*k*</sub>\u2009\u2264\u2009*n* that *a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*j*</sub></sub>\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u2009*b*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*j*</sub> (in other words, if sequence *b* can be obtained from *a* by deleting some of its elements).\n\nIn the first test case the first problem contains the \"find the palindrome next\" permutation as a subsequence, in which the number of inversions equals 1 (words \"palindrome\" and \"next\").\n\nIn the second test case there is no problem that contains a permutation of words from Lesha's problem as a subsequence.",

The present is a surprise box, yet Vasilisa the Wise doesn't know yet what the surprise actually is because she cannot open the box. She hopes that you can help her in that.\n\nThe box's lock is constructed like that. The box itself is represented by an absolutely perfect black cube with the identical deepening on each face (those are some foreign nanotechnologies that the far away kingdom scientists haven't dreamt of). The box is accompanied by six gems whose form matches the deepenings in the box's faces. The box can only be opened after it is correctly decorated by the gems, that is, when each deepening contains exactly one gem. Two ways of decorating the box are considered the same if they can be obtained one from the other one by arbitrarily rotating the box (note that the box is represented by a perfect nanotechnological cube)\n\nNow Vasilisa the Wise wants to know by the given set of colors the following: in how many ways would she decorate the box in the worst case to open it? To answer this question it is useful to know that two gems of one color are indistinguishable from each other. Help Vasilisa to solve this challenging problem.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains exactly 6 characters without spaces from the set {R, O, Y, G, B, V} \u2014 they are the colors of gems with which the box should be decorated.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the required number of different ways to decorate the box.\n\nDemo Input:\n['YYYYYY\\n', 'BOOOOB\\n', 'ROYGBV\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '2\\n', '30\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

As soon as a scroll is used it disappears and another spell is cast upon the boss that inflicts *dmg**i* of damage per second upon him until the end of the game.\n\nDuring the battle the actions per second are performed in the following order: first the boss gets the damage from all the spells cast upon him, then he regenerates *reg* of health (at the same time he can\u2019t have more than *max* of health), then the player may use another scroll (no more than one per second).\n\nThe boss is considered to be defeated if at the end of a second he has nonpositive (<=\u2264<=0) amount of health.\n\nHelp Petya to determine whether he can win with the set of scrolls available to him and if he can, determine the minimal number of seconds he needs to do it.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *N*, *max* and *reg* (1<=\u2264<=*N*,<=*max*,<=*reg*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2013\u2013 the amount of scrolls and the parameters of the boss.

All the secrets cost the same: *n* marks. The state which secrets Gerald is selling, has no paper money, only coins. But there are coins of all positive integer denominations that are powers of three: 1 mark, 3 marks, 9 marks, 27 marks and so on. There are no coins of other denominations. Of course, Gerald likes it when he gets money without the change. And all buyers respect him and try to give the desired sum without change, if possible. But this does not always happen.\n\nOne day an unlucky buyer came. He did not have the desired sum without change. Then he took out all his coins and tried to give Gerald a larger than necessary sum with as few coins as possible. What is the maximum number of coins he could get?\n\nThe formal explanation of the previous paragraph: we consider all the possible combinations of coins for which the buyer can not give Gerald the sum of *n* marks without change. For each such combination calculate the minimum number of coins that can bring the buyer at least *n* marks. Among all combinations choose the maximum of the minimum number of coins. This is the number we want.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe single line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1017).\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64 bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn a single line print an integer: the maximum number of coins the unlucky buyer could have paid with.\n\nDemo Input:\n['1\\n', '4\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '2\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first test case, if a buyer has exactly one coin of at least 3 marks, then, to give Gerald one mark, he will have to give this coin. In this sample, the customer can not have a coin of one mark, as in this case, he will be able to give the money to Gerald without any change.\n\nIn the second test case, if the buyer had exactly three coins of 3 marks, then, to give Gerald 4 marks, he will have to give two of these coins. The buyer cannot give three coins as he wants to minimize the number of coins that he gives.",

        "prompt": "Title: Title\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nVasya has recently finished writing a book. Now he faces the problem of giving it the title. Vasya wants the title to be vague and mysterious for his book to be noticeable among others. That's why the title should be represented by a single word containing at least once each of the first *k* Latin letters and not containing any other ones. Also, the title should be a palindrome, that is it should be read similarly from the left to the right and from the right to the left.\n\nVasya has already composed the approximate variant of the title. You are given the title template *s* consisting of lowercase Latin letters and question marks. Your task is to replace all the question marks by lowercase Latin letters so that the resulting word satisfies the requirements, described above. Each question mark should be replaced by exactly one letter, it is not allowed to delete characters or add new ones to the template. If there are several suitable titles, choose the first in the alphabetical order, for Vasya's book to appear as early as possible in all the catalogues.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=26) which is the number of allowed alphabet letters. The second line contains *s* which is the given template. In *s* only the first *k* lowercase letters of Latin alphabet and question marks can be present, the length of *s* is from 1 to 100 characters inclusively.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf there is no solution, print IMPOSSIBLE. Otherwise, a single line should contain the required title, satisfying the given template. The title should be a palindrome and it can only contain the first *k* letters of the Latin alphabet. At that, each of those *k* letters must be present at least once. If there are several suitable titles, print the lexicographically minimal one. \n\nThe lexicographical comparison is performed by the standard &lt; operator in modern programming languages. The line *a* is lexicographically smaller than the line *b*, if exists such an *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=|*s*|), that *a**i*<=&lt;<=*b**i*, and for any *j* (1<=\u2264<=*j*<=&lt;<=*i*) *a**j*<==<=*b**j*. |*s*| stands for the length of the given template.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\na?c\\n', '2\\na??a\\n', '2\\n?b?a\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['IMPOSSIBLE\\n', 'abba\\n', 'abba\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. Master Heidi needs to select the Jedi Knights who will go on peacekeeping missions throughout the galaxy. It is well-known that the success of any peacekeeping mission depends on the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi who will go on that mission. \n\nHeidi has *n* Jedi Knights standing in front of her, each one with a lightsaber of one of *m* possible colors. She knows that for the mission to be the most effective, she needs to select some contiguous interval of knights such that there are exactly *k*1 knights with lightsabers of the first color, *k*2 knights with lightsabers of the second color, ..., *k**m* knights with lightsabers of the *m*-th color.\n\nHowever, since the last time, she has learned that it is not always possible to select such an interval. Therefore, she decided to ask some Jedi Knights to go on an indefinite unpaid vacation leave near certain pits on Tatooine, if you know what I mean. Help Heidi decide what is the minimum number of Jedi Knights that need to be let go before she is able to select the desired interval from the subsequence of remaining knights.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105) and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*). The second line contains *n* integers in the range {1,<=2,<=...,<=*m*} representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights.

Let's assume that the sizes of the marbles are infinitely small, that is in this task each of them is assumed to be a material point. You can stick pins in some of them and the cost of sticking in the marble number *i* is equal to *c**i*, number *c**i* may be negative. After you choose and stick the pins you need, the marbles will start to roll left according to the rule: if a marble has a pin stuck in it, then the marble doesn't move, otherwise the marble rolls all the way up to the next marble which has a pin stuck in it and stops moving there. If there is no pinned marble on the left to the given unpinned one, it is concluded that the marble rolls to the left to infinity and you will pay an infinitely large fine for it. If no marble rolled infinitely to the left, then the fine will consist of two summands: \n -  the sum of the costs of stuck pins; -  the sum of the lengths of the paths of each of the marbles, that is the sum of absolute values of differences between their initial and final positions. \nYour task is to choose and pin some marbles in the way that will make the fine for you to pay as little as possible.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3000) which is the number of marbles.

There are *n* cows sitting in a row, numbered from 1 to *n* from left to right. Each cow is either facing to the left or facing to the right. When Iahub milks a cow, all the cows that see the current cow get scared and lose one unit of the quantity of milk that they can give. A cow facing left sees all the cows with lower indices than her index, and a cow facing right sees all the cows with higher indices than her index. A cow that got scared once can get scared again (and lose one more unit of milk). A cow that has been milked once cannot get scared and lose any more milk. You can assume that a cow never loses all the milk she can give (a cow gives an infinitely amount of milk).\n\nIahub can decide the order in which he milks the cows. But he must milk each cow exactly once. Iahub wants to lose as little milk as possible.

Travelling to a different town using one railway or one road always takes exactly one hour.\n\nA train and a bus leave town 1 at the same time. They both have the same destination, town *n*, and don't make any stops on the way (but they can wait in town *n*). The train can move only along railways and the bus can move only along roads.\n\nYou've been asked to plan out routes for the vehicles; each route can use any road/railway multiple times. One of the most important aspects to consider is safety\u00a0\u2014 in order to avoid accidents at railway crossings, the train and the bus must not arrive at the same town (except town *n*) simultaneously.\n\nUnder these constraints, what is the minimum number of hours needed for both vehicles to reach town *n* (the maximum of arrival times of the bus and the train)? Note, that bus and train are not required to arrive to the town *n* at the same moment of time, but are allowed to do so.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=400, 0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*(*n*<=-<=1)<=/<=2)\u00a0\u2014 the number of towns and the number of railways respectively.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines contains two integers *u* and *v*, denoting a railway between towns *u* and *v* (1<=\u2264<=*u*,<=*v*<=\u2264<=*n*, *u*<=\u2260<=*v*).\n\nYou may assume that there is at most one railway connecting any two towns.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput one integer\u00a0\u2014 the smallest possible time of the later vehicle's arrival in town *n*.

Choose a subset of the given set of points such that the distance between each pair of points in a subset is an integral power of two. It is necessary to consider each pair of points, not only adjacent. Note that any subset containing one element satisfies the condition above. Among all these subsets, choose a subset with maximum possible size.\n\nIn other words, you have to choose the maximum possible number of points $x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}, \\dots, x_{i_m}$ such that for each pair $x_{i_j}$, $x_{i_k}$ it is true that $|x_{i_j} - x_{i_k}| = 2^d$ where $d$ is some non-negative integer number (not necessarily the same for each pair of points).\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of points.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ pairwise distinct integers $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ ($-10^9 \\le x_i \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the coordinates of points.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print $m$ \u2014 the maximum possible number of points in a subset that satisfies the conditions described above.\n\nIn the second line print $m$ integers \u2014 the coordinates of points in the subset you have chosen.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6\\n3 5 4 7 10 12\\n', '5\\n-1 2 5 8 11\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n7 3 5', '1\\n8\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example the answer is $[7, 3, 5]$.

Dumbledore got fired and now Harry is trying to enter the Chamber of Secrets. These aren't good news for Lord Voldemort. The problem is, he doesn't want anybody to be able to enter the chamber. The Dark Lord is going to be busy sucking life out of Ginny.\n\nThe Chamber of Secrets is an *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* rectangular grid in which some of the cells are columns. A light ray (and a basilisk's gaze) passes through the columns without changing its direction. But with some spell we can make a column magic to reflect the light ray (or the gaze) in all four directions when it receives the ray. This is shown in the figure below.\n\nThe basilisk is located at the right side of the lower right cell of the grid and is looking to the left (in the direction of the lower left cell). According to the legend, anyone who meets a basilisk's gaze directly dies immediately. But if someone meets a basilisk's gaze through a column, this person will get petrified. We know that the door to the Chamber is located on the left side of the upper left corner of the grid and anyone who wants to enter will look in the direction of its movement (in the direction of the upper right cell) from that position.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the chamber and the location of regular columns, Lord Voldemort has asked you to find the minimum number of columns that we need to make magic so that anyone who wants to enter the chamber would be petrified or just declare that it's impossible to secure the chamber.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integer numbers *n* and *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000). Each of the next *n* lines contains *m* characters. Each character is either \".\" or \"#\" and represents one cell of the Chamber grid. It's \".\" if the corresponding cell is empty and \"#\" if it's a regular column.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the minimum number of columns to make magic or -1 if it's impossible to do.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 3\\n.#.\\n...\\n.#.\\n', '4 3\\n##.\\n...\\n.#.\\n.#.\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '2\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe figure above shows the first sample test. In the first sample we should make both columns magic. The dragon figure represents the basilisk and the binoculars represent the person who will enter the Chamber of secrets. The black star shows the place where the person will be petrified. Yellow lines represent basilisk gaze moving through columns.",

        "prompt": "Title: Kuro and Walking Route\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nKuro is living in a country called Uberland, consisting of $n$ towns, numbered from $1$ to $n$, and $n - 1$ bidirectional roads connecting these towns. It is possible to reach each town from any other. Each road connects two towns $a$ and $b$. Kuro loves walking and he is planning to take a walking marathon, in which he will choose a pair of towns $(u, v)$ ($u \\neq v$) and walk from $u$ using the shortest path to $v$ (note that $(u, v)$ is considered to be different from $(v, u)$).\n\nOddly, there are 2 special towns in Uberland named Flowrisa (denoted with the index $x$) and Beetopia (denoted with the index $y$). Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns $(u, v)$ if on the path from $u$ to $v$, he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro\u2019s body and sting him.\n\nKuro wants to know how many pair of city $(u, v)$ he can take as his route. Since he\u2019s not really bright, he asked you to help him with this problem.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers $n$, $x$ and $y$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\leq x, y \\leq n$, $x \\ne y$) - the number of towns, index of the town Flowrisa and index of the town Beetopia, respectively.\n\n$n - 1$ lines follow, each line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$, $a \\ne b$), describes a road connecting two towns $a$ and $b$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that from each town, we can reach every other town in the city using the given roads. That is, the given map of towns and roads is a tree.\n\nOutput Specification:\nA single integer resembles the number of pair of towns $(u, v)$ that Kuro can use as his walking route.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 1 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n', '3 1 3\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['5', '4']\n\nNote:\nOn the first example, Kuro can choose these pairs: \n -  $(1, 2)$: his route would be $1 \\rightarrow 2$, -  $(2, 3)$: his route would be $2 \\rightarrow 3$, -  $(3, 2)$: his route would be $3 \\rightarrow 2$, -  $(2, 1)$: his route would be $2 \\rightarrow 1$, -  $(3, 1)$: his route would be $3 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1$. \nKuro can't choose pair $(1, 3)$ since his walking route would be $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3$, in which Kuro visits town $1$ (Flowrisa) and then visits town $3$ (Beetopia), which is not allowed (note that pair $(3, 1)$ is still allowed because although Kuro visited Flowrisa and Beetopia, he did not visit them in that order).\n\nOn the second example, Kuro can choose the following pairs: \n -  $(1, 2)$: his route would be $1 \\rightarrow 2$, -  $(2, 1)$: his route would be $2 \\rightarrow 1$, -  $(3, 2)$: his route would be $3 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 2$, -  $(3, 1)$: his route would be $3 \\rightarrow 1$.",

        "prompt": "Title: Reberland Linguistics\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nFirst-rate specialists graduate from Berland State Institute of Peace and Friendship. You are one of the most talented students in this university. The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other. \n\nFor example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row. All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word \"suffix\" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to). \n\nHere is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by \"corners\". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for this word is {*aca*,<=*ba*,<=*ca*}.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe only line contains a string *s* (5<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=104) consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOn the first line print integer *k* \u2014 a number of distinct possible suffixes. On the next *k* lines print suffixes. \n\nPrint suffixes in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.\n\nDemo Input:\n['abacabaca\\n', 'abaca\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\naca\\nba\\nca\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe first test was analysed in the problem statement. \n\nIn the second example the length of the string equals 5. The length of the root equals 5, so no string can be used as a suffix.",

He has only one minor issue: he can't count the number of unread notifications generated by those applications (maybe Loki put a curse on it so he can't).\n\n*q* events are about to happen (in chronological order). They are of three types:\n 1.  Application *x* generates a notification (this new notification is unread). 1.  Thor reads all notifications generated so far by application *x* (he may re-read some notifications). 1.  Thor reads the first *t* notifications generated by phone applications (notifications generated in first *t* events of the first type). It's guaranteed that there were at least *t* events of the first type before this event. Please note that he doesn't read first *t* unread notifications, he just reads the very first *t* notifications generated on his phone and he may re-read some of them in this operation. \nPlease help Thor and tell him the number of unread notifications after each event. You may assume that initially there are no notifications in the phone.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains two integers *n* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*q*<=\u2264<=300<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of applications and the number of events to happen.\n\nThe next *q* lines contain the events. The *i*-th of these lines starts with an integer *type**i*\u00a0\u2014 type of the *i*-th event. If *type**i*<==<=1 or *type**i*<==<=2 then it is followed by an integer *x**i*. Otherwise it is followed by an integer *t**i* (1<=\u2264<=*type**i*<=\u2264<=3,<=1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=*q*).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the number of unread notifications after each event.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 4\\n1 3\\n1 1\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n', '4 6\\n1 2\\n1 4\\n1 2\\n3 3\\n1 3\\n1 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n2\\n3\\n2\\n', '1\\n2\\n3\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample:\n 1.

Application 2 generates a notification (there are 3 unread notifications). 1.  Thor reads the notification generated by application 3, there are 2 unread notifications left. \nIn the second sample test:\n 1.  Application 2 generates a notification (there is 1 unread notification). 1.  Application 4 generates a notification (there are 2 unread notifications). 1.  Application 2 generates a notification (there are 3 unread notifications). 1.

In each level, you have a grid with *n* rows and *m* columns. Each cell originally contains the number 0.\n\nOne move consists of choosing one row or column, and adding 1 to all of the cells in that row or column.\n\nTo win the level, after all the moves, the number in the cell at the *i*-th row and *j*-th column should be equal to *g**i*,<=*j*.\n\nKaren is stuck on one level, and wants to know a way to beat this level using the minimum number of moves. Please, help her with this task!\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains two integers, *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid, respectively.\n\nThe next *n* lines each contain *m* integers. In particular, the *j*-th integer in the *i*-th of these rows contains *g**i*,<=*j* (0<=\u2264<=*g**i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=500).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf there is an error and it is actually not possible to beat the level, output a single integer -1.\n\nOtherwise, on the first line, output a single integer *k*, the minimum number of moves necessary to beat the level.\n\nThe next *k* lines should each contain one of the following, describing the moves in the order they must be done:\n -  row *x*, (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*) describing a move of the form \"choose the *x*-th row\". -  col *x*, (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*m*) describing a move of the form \"choose the *x*-th column\". \nIf there are multiple optimal solutions, output any one of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 5\\n2 2 2 3 2\\n0 0 0 1 0\\n1 1 1 2 1\\n', '3 3\\n0 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n0 0 0\\n', '3 3\\n1 1 1\\n1 1 1\\n1 1 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4\\nrow 1\\nrow 1\\ncol 4\\nrow 3\\n', '-1\\n', '3\\nrow 1\\nrow 2\\nrow 3\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first test case, Karen has a grid with 3 rows and 5 columns. She can perform the following 4 moves to beat the level:\n\nIn the second test case, Karen has a grid with 3 rows and 3 columns. It is clear that it is impossible to beat the level; performing any move will create three 1s on the grid, but it is required to only have one 1 in the center.\n\nIn the third test case, Karen has a grid with 3 rows and 3 columns. She can perform the following 3 moves to beat the level:\n\nNote that this is not the only solution; another solution, among others, is col 1, col 2, col 3.",

Quickly, she fetches her HC2 (Handbook of Crazy Constructions) and looks for the right chapter:\n\nHow to build a wall:\n 1.  Take a set of bricks. 1.  Select one of the possible wall designs. Computing the number of possible designs is left as an exercise to the reader. 1.  Place bricks on top of each other, according to the chosen design. \nThis seems easy enough. But Heidi is a Coding Cow, not a Constructing Cow. Her mind keeps coming back to point 2b. Despite the imminent danger of a zombie onslaught, she wonders just how many possible walls she could build with up to *n* bricks.\n\nA wall is a set of wall segments as defined in the easy version. How many different walls can be constructed such that the wall consists of at least 1 and at most *n* bricks? Two walls are different if there exist a column *c* and a row *r* such that one wall has a brick in this spot, and the other does not.\n\nAlong with *n*, you will be given *C*, the width of the wall (as defined in the easy version).

        "prompt": "Title: New Year Contest\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nAs Gerald sets the table, Alexander sends the greeting cards, and Sergey and his twins create an army of clone snowmen, Gennady writes a New Year contest.\n\nThe New Year contest begins at 18:00 (6.00 P.M.) on December 31 and ends at 6:00 (6.00 A.M.) on January 1. There are *n* problems for the contest. The penalty time for each solved problem is set as the distance from the moment of solution submission to the New Year in minutes. For example, the problem submitted at 21:00 (9.00 P.M.) gets penalty time 180, as well as the problem submitted at 3:00 (3.00 A.M.). The total penalty time is calculated as the sum of penalty time for all solved problems. It is allowed to submit a problem exactly at the end of the contest, at 6:00 (6.00 A.M.).\n\nGennady opened the problems exactly at 18:00 (6.00 P.M.) and managed to estimate their complexity during the first 10 minutes of the contest. He believes that writing a solution for the *i*-th problem will take *a**i* minutes. Gennady can submit a solution for evaluation at any time after he completes writing it. Probably he will have to distract from writing some solution to send the solutions of other problems for evaluation. The time needed to send the solutions can be neglected, i.e. this time can be considered to equal zero. Gennady can simultaneously submit multiple solutions. Besides, he can move at any time from writing one problem to another, and then return to the first problem from the very same place, where he has left it. Thus the total solution writing time of the *i*-th problem always equals *a**i* minutes. Of course, Gennady does not commit wrong attempts, and his solutions are always correct and are accepted from the first attempt. He can begin to write the solutions starting from 18:10 (6.10 P.M.).\n\nHelp Gennady choose from the strategies that help him solve the maximum possible number of problems, the one with which his total penalty time will be minimum.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of the problems. The next line contains *n* space-separated integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=720) \u2014 each number shows how much time in minutes Gennady will spend writing a solution to the problem.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint two integers \u2014 the number of problems Gennady will solve and the total penalty time considering that he chooses the optimal strategy.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n30 330 720\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2 10\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the sample, one of Gennady's possible optimal strategies is as follows. At 18:10 (6:10 PM) he begins to write the first problem and solves it in 30 minutes (18:40 or 6.40 P.M.). At 18:40 (6.40 P.M.) he begins to write the second problem. There are 320 minutes left before the New Year, so Gennady does not have the time to finish writing the second problem before the New Year. At 0:00 (12.00 A.M.) he distracts from the second problem, submits the first one, and returns immediately to writing the second problem. At 0:10 (0.10 A.M.), he completes the solution for the second problem, submits it and gets 10 minute penalty time. Note that as the total duration of the contest is 720 minutes and Gennady has already spent 10 minutes on reading the problems, he will not have time to solve the third problem during the contest.

        "prompt": "Title: The Race\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nEvery year a race takes place on the motorway between cities A and B. This year Vanya decided to take part in the race and drive his own car that has been around and bears its own noble name \u2014 The Huff-puffer.\n\nSo, Vasya leaves city A on the Huff-puffer, besides, at the very beginning he fills the petrol tank with \u03b1 liters of petrol (\u03b1<=\u2265<=10 is Vanya's favorite number, it is not necessarily integer). Petrol stations are located on the motorway at an interval of 100 kilometers, i.e. the first station is located 100 kilometers away from the city A, the second one is 200 kilometers away from the city A, the third one is 300 kilometers away from the city A and so on. The Huff-puffer spends 10 liters of petrol every 100 kilometers. \n\nVanya checks the petrol tank every time he passes by a petrol station. If the petrol left in the tank is not enough to get to the next station, Vanya fills the tank with \u03b1 liters of petrol. Otherwise, he doesn't stop at the station and drives on. \n\nFor example, if \u03b1<==<=43.21, then the car will be fuelled up for the first time at the station number 4, when there'll be 3.21 petrol liters left. After the fuelling up the car will have 46.42 liters. Then Vanya stops at the station number 8 and ends up with 6.42<=+<=43.21<==<=49.63 liters. The next stop is at the station number 12, 9.63<=+<=43.21<==<=52.84. The next stop is at the station number 17 and so on. \n\nYou won't believe this but the Huff-puffer has been leading in the race! Perhaps it is due to unexpected snow. Perhaps it is due to video cameras that have been installed along the motorway which register speed limit breaking. Perhaps it is due to the fact that Vanya threatened to junk the Huff-puffer unless the car wins. Whatever the reason is, the Huff-puffer is leading, and jealous people together with other contestants wrack their brains trying to think of a way to stop that outrage.\n\nOne way to do this is to mine the next petrol station where Vanya will stop. Your task is to calculate at which station this will happen and warn Vanya. You don't know the \u03b1 number, however, you are given the succession of the numbers of the stations where Vanya has stopped. Find the number of the station where the next stop will be.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000) which represents the number of petrol stations where Vanya has stopped. The next line has *n* space-separated integers which represent the numbers of the stations. The numbers are positive and do not exceed 106, they are given in the increasing order. No two numbers in the succession match. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one number \u03b1<=\u2265<=10, to which such a succession of stops corresponds.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint in the first line \"unique\" (without quotes) if the answer can be determined uniquely. In the second line print the number of the station where the next stop will take place. If the answer is not unique, print in the first line \"not unique\".\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n1 2 4\\n', '2\\n1 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['unique\\n5\\n', 'not unique\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the second example the answer is not unique. For example, if \u03b1\u2009=\u200910, we'll have such a sequence as 1, 2, 3, and if \u03b1\u2009=\u200914, the sequence will be 1, 2, 4.",

        "prompt": "Title: Wooden Fence\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nVasya has recently bought some land and decided to surround it with a wooden fence.\n\nHe went to a company called \"Wooden board\" that produces wooden boards for fences. Vasya read in the catalog of products that the company has at its disposal *n* different types of wood. The company uses the *i*-th type of wood to produce a board of this type that is a rectangular *a**i* by *b**i* block.\n\nVasya decided to order boards in this company and build a fence from them. It turned out that the storehouse of the company is so large that Vasya can order arbitrary number of boards of every type. Note that Vasya is allowed to turn the boards as he builds the fence. However, Vasya cannot turn square boards.\n\nVasya is required to construct a fence of length *l*, however, an arbitrary fence won't do. Vasya wants his fence to look beautiful. We'll say that a fence is beautiful if and only if the following two conditions are fulfilled:\n -  there are no two successive boards of the same type -  the first board of the fence has an arbitrary length, and the length of each subsequent board equals the width of the previous one \nIn other words, the fence is considered beautiful, if the type of the *i*-th board in the fence is different from the *i*<=-<=1-th board's type; besides, the *i*-th board's length is equal to the *i*<=-<=1-th board's width (for all *i*, starting from 2).\n\nNow Vasya wonders, how many variants of arranging a fence for his land exist. Your task is to count the number of different beautiful fences of length *l*.\n\nTwo fences will be considered the same if the corresponding sequences of fence boards types and rotations are the same, otherwise the fences are different. Since the sought number can be large enough, you need to calculate the answer modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *l* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=3000) \u2014 the number of different board types and the fence length, correspondingly. Next *n* lines contain descriptions of board types: the *i*-th line contains two integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the sizes of the board of the *i*-th type.

Danil was very bored on this lesson until the teacher gave the group a simple task: find 4 vectors in 4-dimensional space, such that every coordinate of every vector is 1 or <=-<=1 and any two vectors are orthogonal. Just as a reminder, two vectors in *n*-dimensional space are considered to be orthogonal if and only if their scalar product is equal to zero, that is: \n\nDanil quickly managed to come up with the solution for this problem and the teacher noticed that the problem can be solved in a more general case for 2*k* vectors in 2*k*-dimensinoal space.

It's no surprise! In his home town, for any pair of intersections there is exactly one way to walk from one intersection to the other one. The capital of Berland is very different!\n\nTomash has noticed that even simple cases of ambiguity confuse him. So, when he sees a group of four distinct intersections *a*, *b*, *c* and *d*, such that there are two paths from *a* to *c* \u2014 one through *b* and the other one through *d*, he calls the group a \"damn rhombus\".

        "prompt": "Title: Laboratory Work\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nAnya and Kirill are doing a physics laboratory work. In one of the tasks they have to measure some value *n* times, and then compute the average value to lower the error.\n\nKirill has already made his measurements, and has got the following integer values: *x*1, *x*2, ..., *x**n*. It is important that the values are close to each other, namely, the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value is at most 2.\n\nAnya does not want to make the measurements, however, she can't just copy the values from Kirill's work, because the error of each measurement is a random value, and this coincidence will be noted by the teacher. Anya wants to write such integer values *y*1, *y*2, ..., *y**n* in her work, that the following conditions are met:\n -  the average value of *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* is equal to the average value of *y*1,<=*y*2,<=...,<=*y**n*;-  all Anya's measurements are in the same bounds as all Kirill's measurements, that is, the maximum value among Anya's values is not greater than the maximum value among Kirill's values, and the minimum value among Anya's values is not less than the minimum value among Kirill's values;-  the number of equal measurements in Anya's work and Kirill's work is as small as possible among options with the previous conditions met. Formally, the teacher goes through all Anya's values one by one, if there is equal value in Kirill's work and it is not strike off yet, he strikes off this Anya's value and one of equal values in Kirill's work. The number of equal measurements is then the total number of strike off values in Anya's work. \nHelp Anya to write such a set of measurements that the conditions above are met.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000) \u2014 the numeber of measurements made by Kirill.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* (<=-<=100<=000<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=100<=000) \u2014 the measurements made by Kirill. It is guaranteed that the difference between the maximum and minimum values among values *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* does not exceed 2.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print the minimum possible number of equal measurements.\n\nIn the second line print *n* integers *y*1,<=*y*2,<=...,<=*y**n* \u2014 the values Anya should write. You can print the integers in arbitrary order. Keep in mind that the minimum value among Anya's values should be not less that the minimum among Kirill's values, and the maximum among Anya's values should be not greater than the maximum among Kirill's values.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6\\n-1 1 1 0 0 -1\\n', '3\\n100 100 101\\n', '7\\n-10 -9 -10 -8 -10 -9 -9\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n0 0 0 0 0 0 \\n', '3\\n101 100 100 \\n', '5\\n-10 -10 -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 \\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example Anya can write zeros as here measurements results. The average value is then equal to the average value of Kirill's values, and there are only two equal measurements.\n\nIn the second example Anya should write two values 100 and one value 101 (in any order), because it is the only possibility to make the average be the equal to the average of Kirill's values. Thus, all three measurements are equal.\n\nIn the third example the number of equal measurements is 5.",

In this game you should transform one word into another through special operations. \n\nLet's say we have word *w*, let's split this word into two non-empty parts *x* and *y* so, that *w*<==<=*xy*. A split operation is transforming word *w*<==<=*xy* into word *u*<==<=*yx*. For example, a split operation can transform word \"wordcut\" into word \"cutword\".\n\nYou are given two words *start* and *end*. Count in how many ways we can transform word *start* into word *end*, if we apply exactly *k* split operations consecutively to word *start*. \n\nTwo ways are considered different if the sequences of applied operations differ. Two operation sequences are different if exists such number *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*k*), that in the *i*-th operation of the first sequence the word splits into parts *x* and *y*, in the *i*-th operation of the second sequence the word splits into parts *a* and *b*, and additionally *x*<=\u2260<=*a* holds.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a non-empty word *start*, the second line contains a non-empty word *end*. The words consist of lowercase Latin letters. The number of letters in word *start* equals the number of letters in word *end* and is at least 2 and doesn't exceed 1000 letters.\n\nThe third line contains integer *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the required number of operations.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number \u2014 the answer to the problem.

The trainer swaps the animals in pairs not to create a mess. He orders two animals to step out of the circle and swap places. As hamsters feel highly uncomfortable when tigers are nearby as well as tigers get nervous when there's so much potential prey around (consisting not only of hamsters but also of yummier spectators), the trainer wants to spend as little time as possible moving the animals, i.e. he wants to achieve it with the minimal number of swaps.

For some integer numbers $x$ and $d$, he chooses an arbitrary position $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) and for every $j \\in [1, n]$ adds $x + d \\cdot dist(i, j)$ to the value of the $j$-th cell. $dist(i, j)$ is the distance between positions $i$ and $j$ (i.e. $dist(i, j) = |i - j|$, where $|x|$ is an absolute value of $x$).\n\nFor example, if Alice currently has an array $[2, 1, 2, 2]$ and Bob chooses position $3$ for $x = -1$ and $d = 2$ then the array will become $[2 - 1 + 2 \\cdot 2,~1 - 1 + 2 \\cdot 1,~2 - 1 + 2 \\cdot 0,~2 - 1 + 2 \\cdot 1]$ = $[5, 2, 1, 3]$.

        "prompt": "Title: Mittens\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nA Christmas party in city S. had *n* children. All children came in mittens. The mittens can be of different colors, but each child had the left and the right mitten of the same color. Let's say that the colors of the mittens are numbered with integers from 1 to *m*, and the children are numbered from 1 to *n*. Then the *i*-th child has both mittens of color *c**i*.\n\nThe Party had Santa Claus ('Father Frost' in Russian), his granddaughter Snow Girl, the children danced around the richly decorated Christmas tree. In fact, everything was so bright and diverse that the children wanted to wear mittens of distinct colors. The children decided to swap the mittens so that each of them got one left and one right mitten in the end, and these two mittens were of distinct colors. All mittens are of the same size and fit all the children.\n\nThe children started exchanging the mittens haphazardly, but they couldn't reach the situation when each child has a pair of mittens of distinct colors. Vasily Petrov, the dad of one of the children, noted that in the general case the children's idea may turn out impossible. Besides, he is a mathematician and he came up with such scheme of distributing mittens that the number of children that have distinct-colored mittens was maximum. You task is to repeat his discovery. Note that the left and right mittens are different: each child must end up with one left and one right mitten.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *m* \u2014 the number of the children and the number of possible mitten colors (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5000, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100). The second line contains *n* integers *c*1,<=*c*2,<=... *c**n*, where *c**i* is the color of the mittens of the *i*-th child (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line, print the maximum number of children who can end up with a distinct-colored pair of mittens. In the next *n* lines print the way the mittens can be distributed in this case. On the *i*-th of these lines print two space-separated integers: the color of the left and the color of the right mitten the *i*-th child will get. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6 3\\n1 3 2 2 1 1\\n', '4 2\\n1 2 1 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['6\\n2 1\\n1 2\\n2 1\\n1 3\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n', '2\\n1 2\\n1 1\\n2 1\\n1 1\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: George and Number\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nGeorge is a cat, so he really likes to play. Most of all he likes to play with his array of positive integers *b*. During the game, George modifies the array by using special changes. Let's mark George's current array as *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b*|*b*| (record |*b*| denotes the current length of the array). Then one change is a sequence of actions: \n -  Choose two distinct indexes *i* and *j* (1<=\u2264<=*i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=|*b*|;\u00a0*i*<=\u2260<=*j*), such that *b**i*<=\u2265<=*b**j*. -  Get number *v*<==<=*concat*(*b**i*,<=*b**j*), where *concat*(*x*,<=*y*) is a number obtained by adding number *y* to the end of the decimal record of number *x*. For example, *concat*(500,<=10)<==<=50010, *concat*(2,<=2)<==<=22. -  Add number *v* to the end of the array. The length of the array will increase by one. -  Remove from the array numbers with indexes *i* and *j*. The length of the array will decrease by two, and elements of the array will become re-numbered from 1 to current length of the array. \nGeorge played for a long time with his array *b* and received from array *b* an array consisting of exactly one number *p*. Now George wants to know: what is the maximum number of elements array *b* could contain originally? Help him find this number. Note that originally the array could contain only positive integers.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer *p* (1<=\u2264<=*p*<=&lt;<=10100000). It is guaranteed that number *p* doesn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint an integer \u2014 the maximum number of elements array *b* could contain originally.\n\nDemo Input:\n['9555\\n', '10000000005\\n', '800101\\n', '45\\n', '1000000000000001223300003342220044555\\n', '19992000\\n', '310200\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4', '2', '3', '1', '17', '1', '2']\n\nNote:\nLet's consider the test examples: \n -  Originally array *b* can be equal to {5,\u20099,\u20095,\u20095}. The sequence of George's changes could have been: {5,\u20099,\u20095,\u20095}\u2009\u2192\u2009{5,\u20095,\u200995}\u2009\u2192\u2009{95,\u200955}\u2009\u2192\u2009{9555}. -  Originally array *b* could be equal to {1000000000,\u20095}. Please note that the array *b* cannot contain zeros. -  Originally array *b* could be equal to {800,\u200910,\u20091}. -  Originally array *b* could be equal to {45}. It cannot be equal to {4,\u20095}, because George can get only array {54} from this array in one operation. \nNote that the numbers can be very large.",

        "prompt": "Title: Gennady the Dentist\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nGennady is one of the best child dentists in Berland. Today *n* children got an appointment with him, they lined up in front of his office.\n\nAll children love to cry loudly at the reception at the dentist. We enumerate the children with integers from 1 to *n* in the order they go in the line. Every child is associated with the value of his cofidence *p**i*. The children take turns one after another to come into the office; each time the child that is the first in the line goes to the doctor.\n\nWhile Gennady treats the teeth of the *i*-th child, the child is crying with the volume of *v**i*. At that the confidence of the first child in the line is reduced by the amount of *v**i*, the second one \u2014 by value *v**i*<=-<=1, and so on. The children in the queue after the *v**i*-th child almost do not hear the crying, so their confidence remains unchanged.\n\nIf at any point in time the confidence of the *j*-th child is less than zero, he begins to cry with the volume of *d**j* and leaves the line, running towards the exit, without going to the doctor's office. At this the confidence of all the children after the *j*-th one in the line is reduced by the amount of *d**j*.\n\nAll these events occur immediately one after the other in some order. Some cries may lead to other cries, causing a chain reaction. Once in the hallway it is quiet, the child, who is first in the line, goes into the doctor's office.\n\nHelp Gennady the Dentist to determine the numbers of kids, whose teeth he will cure. Print their numbers in the chronological order.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=4000) \u2014 the number of kids in the line. \n\nNext *n* lines contain three integers each *v**i*,<=*d**i*,<=*p**i* (1<=\u2264<=*v**i*,<=*d**i*,<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 the volume of the cry in the doctor's office, the volume of the cry in the hall and the confidence of the *i*-th child.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print number *k* \u2014 the number of children whose teeth Gennady will cure.\n\nIn the second line print *k* integers \u2014 the numbers of the children who will make it to the end of the line in the increasing order.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5\\n4 2 2\\n4 1 2\\n5 2 4\\n3 3 5\\n5 1 2\\n', '5\\n4 5 1\\n5 3 9\\n4 1 2\\n2 1 8\\n4 1 9\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n1 3 ', '4\\n1 2 4 5 ']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example, Gennady first treats the teeth of the first child who will cry with volume 4. The confidences of the remaining children will get equal to \u2009-\u20092,\u20091,\u20093,\u20091, respectively. Thus, the second child also cries at the volume of 1 and run to the exit. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 0,\u20092,\u20090. Then the third child will go to the office, and cry with volume 5. The other children won't bear this, and with a loud cry they will run to the exit.\n\nIn the second sample, first the first child goes into the office, he will cry with volume 4. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 5,\u2009\u2009-\u20091,\u20096,\u20098. Thus, the third child will cry with the volume of 1 and run to the exit. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 5,\u20095,\u20097. After that, the second child goes to the office and cry with the volume of 5. The confidences of the remaining children will be equal to 0,\u20093. Then the fourth child will go into the office and cry with the volume of 2. Because of this the confidence of the fifth child will be 1, and he will go into the office last.",

        "prompt": "Title: Parking Lot\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nNowadays it is becoming increasingly difficult to park a car in cities successfully. Let's imagine a segment of a street as long as *L* meters along which a parking lot is located. Drivers should park their cars strictly parallel to the pavement on the right side of the street (remember that in the country the authors of the tasks come from the driving is right side!). Every driver when parking wants to leave for themselves some extra space to move their car freely, that's why a driver is looking for a place where the distance between his car and the one behind his will be no less than *b* meters and the distance between his car and the one in front of his will be no less than *f* meters (if there's no car behind then the car can be parked at the parking lot segment edge; the same is true for the case when there're no cars parked in front of the car). Let's introduce an axis of coordinates along the pavement. Let the parking lot begin at point 0 and end at point *L*. The drivers drive in the direction of the coordinates' increasing and look for the earliest place (with the smallest possible coordinate) where they can park the car. In case there's no such place, the driver drives on searching for his perfect peaceful haven. Sometimes some cars leave the street and free some space for parking. Considering that there never are two moving cars on a street at a time write a program that can use the data on the drivers, entering the street hoping to park there and the drivers leaving it, to model the process and determine a parking lot space for each car.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *L*, *b* \u0438 *f* (10<=\u2264<=*L*<=\u2264<=100000,<=1<=\u2264<=*b*,<=*f*<=\u2264<=100). The second line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) that indicates the number of requests the program has got. Every request is described on a single line and is given by two numbers. The first number represents the request type. If the request type is equal to 1, then in that case the second number indicates the length of a car (in meters) that enters the street looking for a place to park. And if the request type is equal to 2, then the second number identifies the number of such a request (starting with 1) that the car whose arrival to the parking lot was described by a request with this number, leaves the parking lot. It is guaranteed that that car was parked at the moment the request of the 2 type was made. The lengths of cars are integers from 1 to 1000.\n\nOutput Specification:\nFor every request of the 1 type print number -1 on the single line if the corresponding car couldn't find place to park along the street.

Servers are indexed with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$. Suppose that the specifications of the $j$-th server may be expressed with a single integer number $c_j$ of artificial resource units.\n\nIn order for production to work, it is needed to deploy two services $S_1$ and $S_2$ to process incoming requests using the servers of the department. Processing of incoming requests of service $S_i$ takes $x_i$ resource units.\n\nThe described situation happens in an advanced company, that is why each service may be deployed using not only one server, but several servers simultaneously. If service $S_i$ is deployed using $k_i$ servers, then the load is divided equally between these servers and each server requires only $x_i / k_i$ (that may be a fractional number) resource units.\n\nEach server may be left unused at all, or be used for deploying exactly one of the services (but not for two of them simultaneously). The service should not use more resources than the server provides.\n\nDetermine if it is possible to deploy both services using the given servers, and if yes, determine which servers should be used for deploying each of the services.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers $n$, $x_1$, $x_2$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 300\\,000$, $1 \\leq x_1, x_2 \\leq 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of servers that the department may use, and resource units requirements for each of the services.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ space-separated integers $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$ ($1 \\leq c_i \\leq 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of resource units provided by each of the servers.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf it is impossible to deploy both services using the given servers, print the only word \"No\" (without the quotes).\n\nOtherwise print the word \"Yes\" (without the quotes). \n\nIn the second line print two integers $k_1$ and $k_2$ ($1 \\leq k_1, k_2 \\leq n$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of servers used for each of the services.\n\nIn the third line print $k_1$ integers, the indices of the servers that will be used for the first service.\n\nIn the fourth line print $k_2$ integers, the indices of the servers that will be used for the second service.\n\nNo index may appear twice among the indices you print in the last two lines.

Now Igor wants to show his feelings and write a number on the fence opposite to Tanya's house. Igor thinks that the larger the number is, the more chance to win Tanya's heart he has. \n\nUnfortunately, Igor could only get *v* liters of paint. He did the math and concluded that digit *d* requires *a**d* liters of paint. Besides, Igor heard that Tanya doesn't like zeroes.

Heidi will strike hard to destroy them once and for all. But there is a little problem... Before she can strike, she needs to know where the lair is. And the intel she has is not very good.\n\nHeidi knows that the lair can be represented as a rectangle on a lattice, with sides parallel to the axes. Each vertex of the polygon occupies an integer point on the lattice. For each cell of the lattice, Heidi can check the level of Zombie Contamination. This level is an integer between 0 and 4, equal to the number of corners of the cell that are inside or on the border of the rectangle.\n\nAs a test, Heidi wants to check that her Zombie Contamination level checker works. Given the output of the checker, Heidi wants to know whether it could have been produced by a single non-zero area rectangular-shaped lair (with axis-parallel sides). \n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer *N*, the size of the lattice grid (5<=\u2264<=*N*<=\u2264<=50). The next *N* lines each contain *N* characters, describing the level of Zombie Contamination of each cell in the lattice. Every character of every line is a digit between 0 and 4.\n\nCells are given in the same order as they are shown in the picture above: rows go in the decreasing value of *y* coordinate, and in one row cells go in the order of increasing *x* coordinate. This means that the first row corresponds to cells with coordinates (1,<=*N*),<=...,<=(*N*,<=*N*) and the last row corresponds to cells with coordinates (1,<=1),<=...,<=(*N*,<=1).\n\nOutput Specification:\nThe first line of the output should contain Yes if there exists a single non-zero area rectangular lair with corners on the grid for which checking the levels of Zombie Contamination gives the results given in the input, and No otherwise.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6\\n000000\\n000000\\n012100\\n024200\\n012100\\n000000\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['Yes\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe lair, if it exists, has to be rectangular (that is, have corners at some grid points with coordinates (*x*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>,\u2009*y*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>), (*x*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>,\u2009*y*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>), (*x*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>,\u2009*y*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>), (*x*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>,\u2009*y*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>)), has a non-zero area and be contained inside of the grid (that is, 0\u2009\u2264\u2009*x*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>\u2009&lt;\u2009*x*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009\u2264\u2009*N*, 0\u2009\u2264\u2009*y*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>\u2009&lt;\u2009*y*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009\u2264\u2009*N*), and result in the levels of Zombie Contamination as reported in the input.",

He got a question about some strange algorithm on a graph\u00a0\u2014 something that will definitely never be useful in real life. He asked a girl sitting next to him to lend him some cheat papers for this questions and found there the following definition:\n\nThe minimum spanning tree *T* of graph *G* is such a tree that it contains all the vertices of the original graph *G*, and the sum of the weights of its edges is the minimum possible among all such trees.\n\nVladislav drew a graph with *n* vertices and *m* edges containing no loops and multiple edges. He found one of its minimum spanning trees and then wrote for each edge its weight and whether it is included in the found tree or not. Unfortunately, the piece of paper where the graph was painted is gone and the teacher is getting very angry and demands to see the original graph. Help Vladislav come up with a graph so that the information about the minimum spanning tree remains correct.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines describes an edge of the graph and consists of two integers *a**j* and *b**j* (1<=\u2264<=*a**j*<=\u2264<=109,<=*b**j*<==<={0,<=1}). The first of these numbers is the weight of the edge and the second number is equal to 1 if this edge was included in the minimum spanning tree found by Vladislav, or 0 if it was not.\n\nIt is guaranteed that exactly *n*<=-<=1 number {*b**j*} are equal to one and exactly *m*<=-<=*n*<=+<=1 of them are equal to zero.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf Vladislav has made a mistake and such graph doesn't exist, print <=-<=1.\n\nOtherwise print *m* lines.

He is given *n* tasks, each consists of *k* subtasks, numbered 1 through *k*. It takes him *t**j* minutes to solve the *j*-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.\n\nBy solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all *k* of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is *k*<=+<=1.\n\nPolycarp has *M* minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integer numbers *n*, *k* and *M* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=45, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=45, 0<=\u2264<=*M*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7109).\n\nThe second line contains *k* integer numbers, values *t**j* (1<=\u2264<=*t**j*<=\u2264<=1000000), where *t**j* is the time in minutes required to solve *j*-th subtask of any task.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in *M* minutes.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 4 11\\n1 2 3 4\\n', '5 5 10\\n1 2 4 8 16\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['6\\n', '7\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1\u2009+\u20092\u2009+\u20093\u2009+\u20094\u2009=\u200910 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.\n\nIn the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5\u00b71\u2009=\u20095 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2\u00b72\u2009=\u20094 minutes. Thus, he earns 5\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u20097 points in total.",

The *i*-th sensor is located at point (*x**i*,<=*y**i*). All sensors are located at distinct points strictly inside the rectangle. \n\nOpposite corners of the room are located at points (0,<=0) and (*n*,<=*m*). Walls of the room are parallel to coordinate axes.\n\nAt the moment 0, from the point (0,<=0) the laser ray is released in the direction of point (1,<=1). The ray travels with a speed of  meters per second. Thus, the ray will reach the point (1,<=1) in exactly one second after the start.\n\nWhen the ray meets the wall it's reflected by the rule that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. If the ray reaches any of the four corners, it immediately stops.\n\nFor each sensor you have to determine the first moment of time when the ray will pass through the point where this sensor is located. If the ray will never pass through this point, print <=-<=1 for such sensors.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains three integers *n*, *m* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 lengths of the room's walls and the number of sensors.\n\nEach of the following *k* lines contains two integers *x**i* and *y**i* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1, 1<=\u2264<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=*m*<=-<=1)\u00a0\u2014 coordinates of the sensors. It's guaranteed that no two sensors are located at the same point.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *k* integers. The *i*-th of them should be equal to the number of seconds when the ray first passes through the point where the *i*-th sensor is located, or <=-<=1 if this will never happen.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 3 4\\n1 1\\n1 2\\n2 1\\n2 2\\n', '3 4 6\\n1 1\\n2 1\\n1 2\\n2 2\\n1 3\\n2 3\\n', '7 4 5\\n1 3\\n2 2\\n5 1\\n5 3\\n4 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n-1\\n-1\\n2\\n', '1\\n-1\\n-1\\n2\\n5\\n-1\\n', '13\\n2\\n9\\n5\\n-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, the ray will consequently pass through the points (0,\u20090), (1,\u20091), (2,\u20092), (3,\u20093). Thus, it will stop at the point (3,\u20093) after 3 seconds.\n\nIn the second sample, the ray will consequently pass through the following points: (0,\u20090), (1,\u20091), (2,\u20092), (3,\u20093), (2,\u20094), (1,\u20093), (0,\u20092), (1,\u20091), (2,\u20090), (3,\u20091), (2,\u20092), (1,\u20093), (0,\u20094).

Actually, she likes to play with anything whatsoever, cubes or tesseracts, as long as they are multicolored. Each cube is described by two parameters \u2014 color *c**i* and size *s**i*. A Zebra Tower is a tower that consists of cubes of exactly two colors. Besides, the colors of the cubes in the tower must alternate (colors of adjacent cubes must differ). The Zebra Tower should have at least two cubes. There are no other limitations. The figure below shows an example of a Zebra Tower.\n\nA Zebra Tower's height is the sum of sizes of all cubes that form the tower. Help little Janet build the Zebra Tower of the maximum possible height, using the available cubes.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of cubes. Next *n* lines contain the descriptions of the cubes, one description per line. A cube description consists of two space-separated integers *c**i* and *s**i* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*,<=*s**i*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the *i*-th cube's color and size, correspondingly. It is guaranteed that there are at least two cubes of different colors.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the description of the Zebra Tower of the maximum height in the following form. In the first line print the tower's height, in the second line print the number of cubes that form the tower, and in the third line print the space-separated indices of cubes in the order in which they follow in the tower from the bottom to the top. Assume that the cubes are numbered from 1 to *n* in the order in which they were given in the input.\n\nIf there are several existing Zebra Towers with maximum heights, it is allowed to print any of them. \n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n3 3\\n', '2\\n1 1\\n2 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['9\\n3\\n2 3 1 \\n', '2\\n2\\n2 1 \\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Warehouse\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 64 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOnce upon a time, when the world was more beautiful, the sun shone brighter, the grass was greener and the sausages tasted better Arlandia was the most powerful country. And its capital was the place where our hero DravDe worked. He couldn\u2019t program or make up problems (in fact, few people saw a computer those days) but he was nevertheless happy. He worked in a warehouse where a magical but non-alcoholic drink Ogudar-Olok was kept. We won\u2019t describe his work in detail and take a better look at a simplified version of the warehouse.\n\nThe warehouse has one set of shelving. It has *n* shelves, each of which is divided into *m* sections. The shelves are numbered from top to bottom starting from 1 and the sections of each shelf are numbered from left to right also starting from 1. Each section can contain exactly one box of the drink, and try as he might, DravDe can never put a box in a section that already has one. In the course of his work DravDe frequently notices that he has to put a box in a filled section. In that case his solution is simple. DravDe ignores that section and looks at the next one to the right. If it is empty, he puts the box there. Otherwise he keeps looking for the first empty section to the right. If no empty section is found by the end of the shelf, he looks at the shelf which is under it, then the next one, etc. Also each time he looks at a new shelf he starts from the shelf\u2019s beginning. If DravDe still can\u2019t find an empty section for the box, he immediately drinks it all up and throws the empty bottles away not to be caught.\n\nAfter one great party with a lot of Ogudar-Olok drunk DravDe asked you to help him. Unlike him, you can program and therefore modeling the process of counting the boxes in the warehouse will be easy work for you.\n\nThe process of counting contains two types of query messages: \n -  \u00ab+1 x y id\u00bb (where *x*, *y* are integers, 1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*, and *id* is a string of lower case Latin letters \u2014 from 1 to 10 characters long). That query means that the warehouse got a box identified as *id*, which should be put in the section *y* on the shelf *x*. If the section is full, use the rules described above. It is guaranteed that every moment of the process the identifiers of all the boxes in the warehouse are different. You don\u2019t have to answer this query. -  \u00ab-1 id\u00bb (where *id* is a string of lower case Latin letters \u2014 from 1 to 10 characters long). That query means that a box identified as *id* is removed from the warehouse. You have to answer this query (see output format).\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains integers *n*, *m* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=30, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=2000) \u2014 the height, the width of shelving and the amount of the operations in the warehouse that you need to analyze. In the following *k* lines the queries are given in the order of appearance in the format described above.\n\nOutput Specification:\nFor each query of the \u00ab-1 id\u00bb type output two numbers in a separate line \u2014 index of the shelf and index of the section where the box with this identifier lay. If there was no such box in the warehouse when the query was made, output \u00ab-1 -1\u00bb without quotes.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 2 9\\n+1 1 1 cola\\n+1 1 1 fanta\\n+1 1 1 sevenup\\n+1 1 1 whitekey\\n-1 cola\\n-1 fanta\\n-1 sevenup\\n-1 whitekey\\n-1 cola\\n', '2 2 8\\n+1 1 1 cola\\n-1 cola\\n+1 1 1 fanta\\n-1 fanta\\n+1 1 1 sevenup\\n-1 sevenup\\n+1 1 1 whitekey\\n-1 whitekey\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1 1\\n1 2\\n2 1\\n2 2\\n-1 -1\\n', '1 1\\n1 1\\n1 1\\n1 1\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Anya and Smartphone\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nAnya has bought a new smartphone that uses Berdroid operating system. The smartphone menu has exactly *n* applications, each application has its own icon. The icons are located on different screens, one screen contains *k* icons. The icons from the first to the *k*-th one are located on the first screen, from the (*k*<=+<=1)-th to the 2*k*-th ones are on the second screen and so on (the last screen may be partially empty).\n\nInitially the smartphone menu is showing the screen number 1. To launch the application with the icon located on the screen *t*, Anya needs to make the following gestures: first she scrolls to the required screen number *t*, by making *t*<=-<=1 gestures (if the icon is on the screen *t*), and then make another gesture \u2014 press the icon of the required application exactly once to launch it.\n\nAfter the application is launched, the menu returns to the first screen. That is, to launch the next application you need to scroll through the menu again starting from the screen number 1.\n\nAll applications are numbered from 1 to *n*. We know a certain order in which the icons of the applications are located in the menu at the beginning, but it changes as long as you use the operating system. Berdroid is intelligent system, so it changes the order of the icons by moving the more frequently used icons to the beginning of the list. Formally, right after an application is launched, Berdroid swaps the application icon and the icon of a preceding application (that is, the icon of an application on the position that is smaller by one in the order of menu). The preceding icon may possibly be located on the adjacent screen. The only exception is when the icon of the launched application already occupies the first place, in this case the icon arrangement doesn't change.\n\nAnya has planned the order in which she will launch applications. How many gestures should Anya make to launch the applications in the planned order? \n\nNote that one application may be launched multiple times.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains three numbers *n*,<=*m*,<=*k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the number of applications that Anya has on her smartphone, the number of applications that will be launched and the number of icons that are located on the same screen.\n\nThe next line contains *n* integers, permutation *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the initial order of icons from left to right in the menu (from the first to the last one), *a**i*\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 is the id of the application, whose icon goes *i*-th in the menu. Each integer from 1 to *n* occurs exactly once among *a**i*.\n\nThe third line contains *m* integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m*(1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the ids of the launched applications in the planned order. One application may be launched multiple times.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number \u2014 the number of gestures that Anya needs to make to launch all the applications in the desired order.\n\nDemo Input:\n['8 3 3\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\\n7 8 1\\n', '5 4 2\\n3 1 5 2 4\\n4 4 4 4\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['7\\n', '8\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first test the initial configuration looks like (123)(456)(78), that is, the first screen contains icons of applications 1,\u20092,\u20093, the second screen contains icons 4,\u20095,\u20096, the third screen contains icons 7,\u20098. \n\nAfter application 7 is launched, we get the new arrangement of the icons\u00a0\u2014\u00a0(123)(457)(68). To launch it Anya makes 3 gestures. \n\nAfter application 8 is launched, we get configuration (123)(457)(86). To launch it Anya makes 3 gestures. \n\nAfter application 1 is launched, the arrangement of icons in the menu doesn't change. To launch it Anya makes 1 gesture.\n\nIn total, Anya makes 7 gestures.",

You need to find an adjacency matrix of such an undirected graph that the number of components in it is equal to $a$, and the number of components in its complement is $b$. The matrix must be symmetric, and all digits on the main diagonal must be zeroes.\n\nIn an undirected graph loops (edges from a vertex to itself) are not allowed. It can be at most one edge between a pair of vertices.\n\nThe adjacency matrix of an undirected graph is a square matrix of size $n$ consisting only of \"0\" and \"1\", where $n$ is the number of vertices of the graph and the $i$-th row and the $i$-th column correspond to the $i$-th vertex of the graph. The cell $(i,j)$ of the adjacency matrix contains $1$ if and only if the $i$-th and $j$-th vertices in the graph are connected by an edge.\n\nA connected component is a set of vertices $X$ such that for every two vertices from this set there exists at least one path in the graph connecting this pair of vertices, but adding any other vertex to $X$ violates this rule.\n\nThe complement or inverse of a graph $G$ is a graph $H$ on the same vertices such that two distinct vertices of $H$ are adjacent if and only if they are not adjacent in $G$.\n\nInput Specification:\nIn a single line, three numbers are given $n, a, b \\,(1 \\le n \\le 1000, 1 \\le a, b \\le n)$: is the number of vertexes of the graph, the required number of connectivity components in it, and the required amount of the connectivity component in it's complement.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf there is no graph that satisfies these constraints on a single line, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\nOtherwise, on the first line, print \"YES\"(without quotes). In each of the next $n$ lines, output $n$ digits such that $j$-th digit of $i$-th line must be $1$ if and only if there is an edge between vertices $i$ and $j$ in $G$ (and $0$ otherwise).

When you put a logo on the billboard, you should rotate it so that the sides were parallel to the sides of the billboard.\n\nYour task is to determine if it is possible to put the logos of all the three companies on some square billboard without breaking any of the described rules.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains six positive integers *x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2,<=*x*3,<=*y*3 (1<=\u2264<=*x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2,<=*x*3,<=*y*3<=\u2264<=100), where *x**i* and *y**i* determine the length and width of the logo of the *i*-th company respectively.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf it is impossible to place all the three logos on a square shield, print a single integer \"-1\" (without the quotes).\n\nIf it is possible, print in the first line the length of a side of square *n*, where you can place all the three logos. Each of the next *n* lines should contain *n* uppercase English letters \"A\", \"B\" or \"C\". The sets of the same letters should form solid rectangles, provided that:\n -  the sizes of the rectangle composed from letters \"A\" should be equal to the sizes of the logo of the first company, -  the sizes of the rectangle composed from letters \"B\" should be equal to the sizes of the logo of the second company, -  the sizes of the rectangle composed from letters \"C\" should be equal to the sizes of the logo of the third company, \nNote that the logos of the companies can be rotated for printing on the billboard. The billboard mustn't have any empty space. If a square billboard can be filled with the logos in multiple ways, you are allowed to print any of them.\n\nSee the samples to better understand the statement.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 1 2 5 5 2\\n', '4 4 2 6 4 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['5\\nAAAAA\\nBBBBB\\nBBBBB\\nCCCCC\\nCCCCC\\n', '6\\nBBBBBB\\nBBBBBB\\nAAAACC\\nAAAACC\\nAAAACC\\nAAAACC\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

Now the game should be played on an undirected rooted tree of *n* vertices. Vertex 1 is the root of the tree.\n\nAlice starts at vertex 1 and Bob starts at vertex *x* (*x*<=\u2260<=1). The moves are made in turns, Bob goes first. In one move one can either stay at the current vertex or travel to the neighbouring one.\n\nThe game ends when Alice goes to the same vertex where Bob is standing.

He used the lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet from 'a' to 'j' and replaced all digits 0 with one letter, all digits 1 with another letter and so on. For any two different digits Vasya used distinct letters from 'a' to 'j'.\n\nYour task is to restore Petya's numbers. The restored numbers should be positive integers without leading zeros. Since there can be multiple ways to do it, determine the minimum possible sum of all Petya's numbers after the restoration. It is guaranteed that before Vasya's joke all Petya's numbers did not have leading zeros.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1<=000) \u2014 the number of Petya's numbers.\n\nEach of the following lines contains non-empty string *s**i* consisting of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'j' \u2014 the Petya's numbers after Vasya's joke.

So after the restoration numbers will look like [10,\u200923,\u200914]. The sum of them is equal to 47, which is the minimum possible sum of the numbers after the correct restoration.\n\nIn the second example the numbers after the restoration can look like: [120468,\u20093579,\u20092468,\u200910024,\u20093]. \n\nIn the second example the numbers after the restoration can look like: [11,\u200922,\u200911].",

        "prompt": "Title: Try and Catch\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nVasya is developing his own programming language VPL (Vasya Programming Language). Right now he is busy making the system of exceptions. He thinks that the system of exceptions must function like that.\n\nThe exceptions are processed by try-catch-blocks. There are two operators that work with the blocks:\n1.  The try operator. It opens a new try-catch-block. 1.  The catch(&lt;exception_type&gt;, &lt;message&gt;) operator. It closes the try-catch-block that was started last and haven't yet been closed. This block can be activated only via exception of type &lt;exception_type&gt;. When we activate this block, the screen displays the &lt;message&gt;. If at the given moment there is no open try-catch-block, then we can't use the catch operator.\nThe exceptions can occur in the program in only one case: when we use the throw operator. The throw(&lt;exception_type&gt;) operator creates the exception of the given type.\n\nLet's suggest that as a result of using some throw operator the program created an exception of type *a*. In this case a try-catch-block is activated, such that this block's try operator was described in the program earlier than the used throw operator. Also, this block's catch operator was given an exception type *a* as a parameter and this block's catch operator is described later that the used throw operator. If there are several such try-catch-blocks, then the system activates the block whose catch operator occurs earlier than others. If no try-catch-block was activated, then the screen displays message \"Unhandled Exception\".\n\nTo test the system, Vasya wrote a program that contains only try, catch and throw operators, one line contains no more than one operator, the whole program contains exactly one throw operator.\n\nYour task is: given a program in VPL, determine, what message will be displayed on the screen.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer: *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) the number of lines in the program. Next *n* lines contain the program in language VPL. Each line contains no more than one operator. It means that input file can contain empty lines and lines, consisting only of spaces.\n\nThe program contains only operators try, catch and throw. It is guaranteed that the program is correct. It means that each started try-catch-block was closed, the catch operators aren't used unless there is an open try-catch-block. The program has exactly one throw operator. The program may have spaces at the beginning of a line, at the end of a line, before and after a bracket, a comma or a quote mark.\n\nThe exception type is a nonempty string, that consists only of upper and lower case english letters. The length of the string does not exceed 20 symbols. Message is a nonempty string, that consists only of upper and lower case english letters, digits and spaces. Message is surrounded with quote marks. Quote marks shouldn't be printed. The length of the string does not exceed 20 symbols.\n\nLength of any line in the input file does not exceed 50 symbols.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the message the screen will show after the given program is executed.\n\nDemo Input:\n['8\\ntry\\n    try\\n        throw ( AE ) \\n    catch ( BE, \"BE in line 3\")\\n\\n    try\\n    catch(AE, \"AE in line 5\") \\ncatch(AE,\"AE somewhere\")\\n', '8\\ntry\\n    try\\n        throw ( AE ) \\n    catch ( AE, \"AE in line 3\")\\n\\n    try\\n    catch(BE, \"BE in line 5\") \\ncatch(AE,\"AE somewhere\")\\n', '8\\ntry\\n    try\\n        throw ( CE ) \\n    catch ( BE, \"BE in line 3\")\\n\\n    try\\n    catch(AE, \"AE in line 5\") \\ncatch(AE,\"AE somewhere\")\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['AE somewhere\\n', 'AE in line 3\\n', 'Unhandled Exception\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample there are 2 try-catch-blocks such that try operator is described earlier than throw operator and catch operator is described later than throw operator: try-catch(BE,\"BE in line 3\") and try-catch(AE,\"AE somewhere\"). Exception type is AE, so the second block will be activated, because operator catch(AE,\"AE somewhere\") has exception type AE as parameter and operator catch(BE,\"BE in line 3\") has exception type BE.\n\nIn the second sample there are 2 try-catch-blocks such that try operator is described earlier than throw operator and catch operator is described later than throw operator: try-catch(AE,\"AE in line 3\") and try-catch(AE,\"AE somewhere\"). Exception type is AE, so both blocks can be activated, but only the first one will be activated, because operator catch(AE,\"AE in line 3\") is described earlier than catch(AE,\"AE somewhere\")\n\nIn the third sample there is no blocks that can be activated by an exception of type CE.",

You will consider your performance good if you win at least *l* tours.\n\nIn fact, years of organizing contests proved to the organizers that transporting huge prizes is an issue for the participants. Alas, no one has ever invented a spell that would shrink the prizes... So, here's the solution: for some tours the winner gets a bag instead of a huge prize. Each bag is characterized by number *a**i* \u2014 the number of huge prizes that will fit into it.\n\nYou already know the subject of all tours, so you can estimate the probability *p**i* of winning the *i*-th tour. You cannot skip the tour under any circumstances.\n\nFind the probability that you will perform well on the contest and will be able to take all won prizes home (that is, that you will be able to fit all the huge prizes that you won into the bags that you either won or brought from home).\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *l*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200,<=0<=\u2264<=*l*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=200) \u2014 the number of tours, the minimum number of tours to win, and the number of prizes that you can fit in the bags brought from home, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line contains *n* space-separated integers, *p**i* (0<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the probability to win the *i*-th tour, in percents.\n\nThe third line contains *n* space-separated integers, *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=200) \u2014 the capacity of the bag that will be awarded to you for winning the *i*-th tour, or else -1, if the prize for the *i*-th tour is a huge prize and not a bag.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single real number \u2014 the answer to the problem. The answer will be accepted if the absolute or relative error does not exceed 10<=-<=6.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 1 0\\n10 20 30\\n-1 -1 2\\n', '1 1 1\\n100\\n123\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0.300000000000\\n', '1.000000000000\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample we need either win no tour or win the third one. If we win nothing we wouldn't perform well. So, we must to win the third tour. Other conditions will be satisfied in this case. Probability of wining the third tour is 0.3.\n\nIn the second sample we win the only tour with probability 1.0, and go back home with bag for it.",

        "prompt": "Title: Arpa's loud Owf and Mehrdad's evil plan\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nAs you have noticed, there are lovely girls in Arpa\u2019s land.\n\nPeople in Arpa's land are numbered from 1 to *n*. Everyone has exactly one crush, *i*-th person's crush is person with the number *crush**i*.\n\nSomeday Arpa shouted Owf loudly from the top of the palace and a funny game started in Arpa's land. The rules are as follows.\n\nThe game consists of rounds. Assume person *x* wants to start a round, he calls *crush**x* and says: \"Oww...wwf\" (the letter w is repeated *t* times) and cuts off the phone immediately. If *t*<=&gt;<=1 then *crush**x* calls *crush**crush**x* and says: \"Oww...wwf\" (the letter w is repeated *t*<=-<=1 times) and cuts off the phone immediately. The round continues until some person receives an \"Owf\" (*t*<==<=1). This person is called the Joon-Joon of the round. There can't be two rounds at the same time.\n\nMehrdad has an evil plan to make the game more funny, he wants to find smallest *t* (*t*<=\u2265<=1) such that for each person *x*, if *x* starts some round and *y* becomes the Joon-Joon of the round, then by starting from *y*, *x* would become the Joon-Joon of the round. Find such *t* for Mehrdad if it's possible.\n\nSome strange fact in Arpa's land is that someone can be himself's crush (i.e. *crush**i*<==<=*i*).\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of people in Arpa's land.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers, *i*-th of them is *crush**i* (1<=\u2264<=*crush**i*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of *i*-th person's crush.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf there is no *t* satisfying the condition, print -1. Otherwise print such smallest *t*.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n2 3 1 4\\n', '4\\n4 4 4 4\\n', '4\\n2 1 4 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n', '-1\\n', '1\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample suppose *t*\u2009=\u20093. \n\nIf the first person starts some round:\n\nThe first person calls the second person and says \"Owwwf\", then the second person calls the third person and says \"Owwf\", then the third person calls the first person and says \"Owf\", so the first person becomes Joon-Joon of the round. So the condition is satisfied if *x* is 1.\n\nThe process is similar for the second and the third person.\n\nIf the fourth person starts some round:\n\nThe fourth person calls himself and says \"Owwwf\", then he calls himself again and says \"Owwf\", then he calls himself for another time and says \"Owf\", so the fourth person becomes Joon-Joon of the round. So the condition is satisfied when *x* is 4.\n\nIn the last example if the first person starts a round, then the second person becomes the Joon-Joon, and vice versa.",

        "prompt": "Title: Logo Turtle\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nA lot of people associate Logo programming language with turtle graphics. In this case the turtle moves along the straight line and accepts commands \"T\" (\"turn around\") and \"F\" (\"move 1 unit forward\").\n\nYou are given a list of commands that will be given to the turtle. You have to change exactly *n* commands from the list (one command can be changed several times). How far from the starting point can the turtle move after it follows all the commands of the modified list?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains a string *commands* \u2014 the original list of commands. The string *commands* contains between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, and contains only characters \"T\" and \"F\".\n\nThe second line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50) \u2014 the number of commands you have to change in the list.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput the maximum distance from the starting point to the ending point of the turtle's path. The ending point of the turtle's path is turtle's coordinate after it follows all the commands of the modified list.\n\nDemo Input:\n['FT\\n1\\n', 'FFFTFFF\\n2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '6\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example the best option is to change the second command (\"T\") to \"F\" \u2014 this way the turtle will cover a distance of 2 units.\n\nIn the second example you have to change two commands.

Every morning the artist takes a piece of graph paper and starts with making a model of his future canvas. He takes a square as big as *n*<=\u00d7<=*n* squares and paints some of them black. Then he takes a clean square piece of paper and paints the fractal using the following algorithm: \n\nStep 1. The paper is divided into *n*2 identical squares and some of them are painted black according to the model.\n\nStep 2. Every square that remains white is divided into *n*2 smaller squares and some of them are painted black according to the model.\n\nEvery following step repeats step 2.\n\nUnfortunately, this tiresome work demands too much time from the painting genius. Kalevitch has been dreaming of making the process automatic to move to making 3D or even 4D fractals.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integers *n* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=5), where *k* is the amount of steps of the algorithm. Each of the following *n* lines contains *n* symbols that determine the model. Symbol \u00ab.\u00bb stands for a white square, whereas \u00ab*\u00bb stands for a black one. It is guaranteed that the model has at least one white square.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput a matrix *n**k*<=\u00d7<=*n**k* which is what a picture should look like after *k* steps of the algorithm.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 3\\n.*\\n..\\n', '3 2\\n.*.\\n***\\n.*.\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['.*******\\n..******\\n.*.*****\\n....****\\n.***.***\\n..**..**\\n.*.*.*.*\\n........\\n', '.*.***.*.\\n*********\\n.*.***.*.\\n*********\\n*********\\n*********\\n.*.***.*.\\n*********\\n.*.***.*.\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

As a hausmeister of DHBW, Sagheer waits till all students and professors leave the university building, then goes and turns all the lights off.\n\nThe building consists of *n* floors with stairs at the left and the right sides. Each floor has *m* rooms on the same line with a corridor that connects the left and right stairs passing by all the rooms. In other words, the building can be represented as a rectangle with *n* rows and *m*<=+<=2 columns, where the first and the last columns represent the stairs, and the *m* columns in the middle represent rooms.\n\nSagheer is standing at the ground floor at the left stairs. He wants to turn all the lights off in such a way that he will not go upstairs until all lights in the floor he is standing at are off. Of course, Sagheer must visit a room to turn the light there off. It takes one minute for Sagheer to go to the next floor using stairs or to move from the current room/stairs to a neighboring room/stairs on the same floor. It takes no time for him to switch the light off in the room he is currently standing in. Help Sagheer find the minimum total time to turn off all the lights.\n\nNote that Sagheer does not have to go back to his starting position, and he does not have to visit rooms where the light is already switched off.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=15 and 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of floors and the number of rooms in each floor, respectively.\n\nThe next *n* lines contains the building description. Each line contains a binary string of length *m*<=+<=2 representing a floor (the left stairs, then *m* rooms, then the right stairs) where 0 indicates that the light is off and 1 indicates that the light is on. The floors are listed from top to bottom, so that the last line represents the ground floor.\n\nThe first and last characters of each string represent the left and the right stairs, respectively, so they are always 0.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum total time needed to turn off all the lights.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 2\\n0010\\n0100\\n', '3 4\\n001000\\n000010\\n000010\\n', '4 3\\n01110\\n01110\\n01110\\n01110\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['5\\n', '12\\n', '18\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example, Sagheer will go to room 1 in the ground floor, then he will go to room 2 in the second floor using the left or right stairs.\n\nIn the second example, he will go to the fourth room in the ground floor, use right stairs, go to the fourth room in the second floor, use right stairs again, then go to the second room in the last floor.\n\nIn the third example, he will walk through the whole corridor alternating between the left and right stairs at each floor.",

        "prompt": "Title: Epidemic in Monstropolis\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThere was an epidemic in Monstropolis and all monsters became sick. To recover, all monsters lined up in queue for an appointment to the only doctor in the city.\n\nSoon, monsters became hungry and began to eat each other. \n\nOne monster can eat other monster if its weight is strictly greater than the weight of the monster being eaten, and they stand in the queue next to each other. Monsters eat each other instantly. There are no monsters which are being eaten at the same moment. After the monster *A* eats the monster *B*, the weight of the monster *A* increases by the weight of the eaten monster *B*. In result of such eating the length of the queue decreases by one, all monsters after the eaten one step forward so that there is no empty places in the queue again. A monster can eat several monsters one after another. Initially there were *n* monsters in the queue, the *i*-th of which had weight *a**i*.\n\nFor example, if weights are [1,<=2,<=2,<=2,<=1,<=2] (in order of queue, monsters are numbered from 1 to 6 from left to right) then some of the options are:\n 1.  the first monster can't eat the second monster because *a*1<==<=1 is not greater than *a*2<==<=2; 1.  the second monster can't eat the third monster because *a*2<==<=2 is not greater than *a*3<==<=2; 1.  the second monster can't eat the fifth monster because they are not neighbors; 1.  the second monster can eat the first monster, the queue will be transformed to [3,<=2,<=2,<=1,<=2]. \nAfter some time, someone said a good joke and all monsters recovered. At that moment there were *k* (*k*<=\u2264<=*n*) monsters in the queue, the *j*-th of which had weight *b**j*. Both sequences (*a* and *b*) contain the weights of the monsters in the order from the first to the last.\n\nYou are required to provide one of the possible orders of eating monsters which led to the current queue, or to determine that this could not happen. Assume that the doctor didn't make any appointments while monsters were eating each other.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=500)\u00a0\u2014 the number of monsters in the initial queue.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=106)\u00a0\u2014 the initial weights of the monsters.\n\nThe third line contains single integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of monsters in the queue after the joke. \n\nThe fourth line contains *k* integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**k* (1<=\u2264<=*b**j*<=\u2264<=5\u00b7108)\u00a0\u2014 the weights of the monsters after the joke. \n\nMonsters are listed in the order from the beginning of the queue to the end.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn case if no actions could lead to the final queue, print \"NO\" (without quotes) in the only line. \n\nOtherwise print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the first line. In the next *n*<=-<=*k* lines print actions in the chronological order. In each line print *x*\u00a0\u2014 the index number of the monster in the current queue which eats and, separated by space, the symbol 'L' if the monster which stays the *x*-th in the queue eats the monster in front of him, or 'R' if the monster which stays the *x*-th in the queue eats the monster behind him. After each eating the queue is enumerated again. \n\nWhen one monster eats another the queue decreases. If there are several answers, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6\\n1 2 2 2 1 2\\n2\\n5 5\\n', '5\\n1 2 3 4 5\\n1\\n15\\n', '5\\n1 1 1 3 3\\n3\\n2 1 6\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n2 L\\n1 R\\n4 L\\n3 L\\n', 'YES\\n5 L\\n4 L\\n3 L\\n2 L\\n', 'NO']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example, initially there were *n*\u2009=\u20096 monsters, their weights are [1,\u20092,\u20092,\u20092,\u20091,\u20092] (in order of queue from the first monster to the last monster). The final queue should be [5,\u20095]. The following sequence of eatings leads to the final queue:\n -  the second monster eats the monster to the left (i.e. the first monster), queue becomes [3,\u20092,\u20092,\u20091,\u20092]; -  the first monster (note, it was the second on the previous step) eats the monster to the right (i.e. the second monster), queue becomes [5,\u20092,\u20091,\u20092]; -  the fourth monster eats the mosnter to the left (i.e. the third monster), queue becomes [5,\u20092,\u20093]; -  the finally, the third monster eats the monster to the left (i.e. the second monster), queue becomes [5,\u20095]. \nNote that for each step the output contains numbers of the monsters in their current order in the queue.",

This time the Beaver invites the contest participants to check out a problem on sorting documents by their subjects. Let's describe the problem:\n\nYou've got some training set of documents. For each document you know its subject. The subject in this problem is an integer from 1 to 3. Each of these numbers has a physical meaning. For instance, all documents with subject 3 are about trade.\n\nYou can download the training set of documents at the following link: http://download4.abbyy.com/a2/X2RZ2ZWXBG5VYWAL61H76ZQM/train.zip. The archive contains three directories with names \"1\", \"2\", \"3\". Directory named \"1\" contains documents on the 1-st subject, directory \"2\" contains documents on the 2-nd subject, and directory \"3\" contains documents on the 3-rd subject. Each document corresponds to exactly one file from some directory.\n\nAll documents have the following format: the first line contains the document identifier, the second line contains the name of the document, all subsequent lines contain the text of the document. The document identifier is used to make installing the problem more convenient and has no useful information for the participants.\n\nYou need to write a program that should indicate the subject for a given document. It is guaranteed that all documents given as input to your program correspond to one of the three subjects of the training set.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *id* (0<=\u2264<=*id*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 the document identifier. The second line contains the name of the document. The third and the subsequent lines contain the text of the document. It is guaranteed that the size of any given document will not exceed 10 kilobytes.\n\nThe tests for this problem are divided into 10 groups. Documents of groups 1 and 2 are taken from the training set, but their identifiers will not match the identifiers specified in the training set. Groups from the 3-rd to the 10-th are roughly sorted by the author in ascending order of difficulty (these groups contain documents which aren't present in the training set).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint an integer from 1 to 3, inclusive \u2014 the number of the subject the given document corresponds to.\n\nNote:\nnone",

We will consider the rows of the field numbered with integers from 1 to 109 from top to bottom. The columns are similarly numbered with integers from 1 to 109 from left to right. We will denote a cell of the field that is located in the *i*-th row and *j*-th column as (*i*,<=*j*).\n\nYou know that some squares of the given chess field are allowed. All allowed cells of the chess field are given as *n* segments. Each segment is described by three integers *r**i*,<=*a**i*,<=*b**i* (*a**i*<=\u2264<=*b**i*), denoting that cells in columns from number *a**i* to number *b**i* inclusive in the *r**i*-th row are allowed.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of moves the king needs to get from square (*x*0,<=*y*0) to square (*x*1,<=*y*1), provided that he only moves along the allowed cells. In other words, the king can be located only on allowed cells on his way.\n\nLet us remind you that a chess king can move to any of the neighboring cells in one move. Two cells of a chess field are considered neighboring if they share at least one point.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains four space-separated integers *x*0,<=*y*0,<=*x*1,<=*y*1 (1<=\u2264<=*x*0,<=*y*0,<=*x*1,<=*y*1<=\u2264<=109), denoting the initial and the final positions of the king.\n\nThe second line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105), denoting the number of segments of allowed cells. Next *n* lines contain the descriptions of these segments. The *i*-th line contains three space-separated integers *r**i*,<=*a**i*,<=*b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*r**i*,<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=109,<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*b**i*), denoting that cells in columns from number *a**i* to number *b**i* inclusive in the *r**i*-th row are allowed. Note that the segments of the allowed cells can intersect and embed arbitrarily.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the king's initial and final position are allowed cells.

        "prompt": "Title: Too Easy Problems\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nYou are preparing for an exam on scheduling theory. The exam will last for exactly *T* milliseconds and will consist of *n* problems. You can either solve problem *i* in exactly *t**i* milliseconds or ignore it and spend no time. You don't need time to rest after solving a problem, either.\n\nUnfortunately, your teacher considers some of the problems too easy for you. Thus, he assigned an integer *a**i* to every problem *i* meaning that the problem *i* can bring you a point to the final score only in case you have solved no more than *a**i* problems overall (including problem *i*).\n\nFormally, suppose you solve problems *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k* during the exam. Then, your final score *s* will be equal to the number of values of *j* between 1 and *k* such that *k*<=\u2264<=*a**p**j*.\n\nYou have guessed that the real first problem of the exam is already in front of you. Therefore, you want to choose a set of problems to solve during the exam maximizing your final score in advance. Don't forget that the exam is limited in time, and you must have enough time to solve all chosen problems. If there exist different sets of problems leading to the maximum final score, any of them will do.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *T* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105; 1<=\u2264<=*T*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 the number of problems in the exam and the length of the exam in milliseconds, respectively.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains two integers *a**i* and *t**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*; 1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=104). The problems are numbered from 1 to *n*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line, output a single integer *s*\u00a0\u2014 your maximum possible final score.\n\nIn the second line, output a single integer *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of problems you should solve.\n\nIn the third line, output *k* distinct integers *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the indexes of problems you should solve, in any order.\n\nIf there are several optimal sets of problems, you may output any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 300\\n3 100\\n4 150\\n4 80\\n2 90\\n2 300\\n', '2 100\\n1 787\\n2 788\\n', '2 100\\n2 42\\n2 58\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n3\\n3 1 4\\n', '0\\n0\\n\\n', '2\\n2\\n1 2\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example, you should solve problems 3, 1, and 4. In this case you'll spend 80\u2009+\u2009100\u2009+\u200990\u2009=\u2009270 milliseconds, falling within the length of the exam, 300 milliseconds (and even leaving yourself 30 milliseconds to have a rest). Problems 3 and 1 will bring you a point each, while problem 4 won't. You'll score two points.\n\nIn the second example, the length of the exam is catastrophically not enough to solve even a single problem.\n\nIn the third example, you have just enough time to solve both problems in 42\u2009+\u200958\u2009=\u2009100 milliseconds and hand your solutions to the teacher with a smile.",

Of course, safes, wardrobes, cruisers, planes fall sometimes too... But anvils do so most of all.\n\nAnvils come in different sizes and shapes. Quite often they get the hero stuck deep in the ground. But have you ever thought who throws anvils from the sky? From what height?

Let's describe one of the most popular anvil throwing models.\n\nLet the height *p* of the potential victim vary in the range [0;*a*] and the direction of the wind *q* vary in the range [<=-<=*b*;*b*]. *p* and *q* could be any real (floating) numbers.

        "prompt": "Title: Sereja and Contest\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nDuring the last Sereja's Codesecrof round the server crashed many times, so the round was decided to be made unrated for some participants. \n\nLet's assume that *n* people took part in the contest. Let's assume that the participant who got the first place has rating *a*1, the second place participant has rating *a*2, ..., the *n*-th place participant has rating *a**n*. Then changing the rating on the Codesecrof site is calculated by the formula .\n\nAfter the round was over, the Codesecrof management published the participants' results table. They decided that if for a participant *d**i*<=&lt;<=*k*, then the round can be considered unrated for him. But imagine the management's surprise when they found out that the participants' rating table is dynamic. In other words, when some participant is removed from the rating, he is removed from the results' table and the rating is recalculated according to the new table. And of course, all applications for exclusion from the rating are considered in view of the current table.\n\nWe know that among all the applications for exclusion from the rating the first application to consider is from the participant with the best rank (the rank with the minimum number), for who *d**i*<=&lt;<=*k*. We also know that the applications for exclusion from rating were submitted by all participants.\n\nNow Sereja wonders, what is the number of participants to be excluded from the contest rating, and the numbers of the participants in the original table in the order of their exclusion from the rating. Pay attention to the analysis of the first test case for a better understanding of the statement.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105,<=<=-<=109<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=0). The second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 ratings of the participants in the initial table.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the numbers of participants in the order in which they were removed from the table. Print the initial numbers of the participants, that is, the numbers that the participants had in the initial table.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 0\\n5 3 4 1 2\\n', '10 -10\\n5 5 1 7 5 1 2 4 9 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n3\\n4\\n', '2\\n4\\n5\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n']\n\nNote:\nConsider the first test sample. \n1.  Initially the sequence of the contest participants' ratings equals [5, 3, 4, 1, 2]. You can use this sequence to calculate the sequence of rating changes: [0, -9, -13, 8, 14]. According to the problem statement, the application of the participant who won the second place will be considered first.1.  As soon as the second place winner is out from the ratings, the participants' rating sequence will equal [5, 4, 1, 2]. By this sequence you can count the new sequence of rating changes: [0, -8, 2, 6]. According to the problem statement, the application of the participant who won the second place will be considered. Initially this participant won third place.1.  The new rating sequence equals [5, 1, 2], the new sequence of rating changes equals [0, -1, 1]. The second place participant's application is taken into consideration, initially this participant won the fourth place.1.  The new rating sequence equals [5, 2], the new sequence of rating changes equals [0, 0]. No more applications will be considered. \nThus, you should print 2, 3, 4.",

        "prompt": "Title: Shockers\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nValentin participates in a show called \"Shockers\". The rules are quite easy: jury selects one letter which Valentin doesn't know. He should make a small speech, but every time he pronounces a word that contains the selected letter, he receives an electric shock. He can make guesses which letter is selected, but for each incorrect guess he receives an electric shock too. The show ends when Valentin guesses the selected letter correctly.\n\nValentin can't keep in mind everything, so he could guess the selected letter much later than it can be uniquely determined and get excessive electric shocks. Excessive electric shocks are those which Valentin got after the moment the selected letter can be uniquely determined. You should find out the number of excessive electric shocks.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of actions Valentin did.\n\nThe next *n* lines contain descriptions of his actions, each line contains description of one action. Each action can be of one of three types: \n 1.  Valentin pronounced some word and didn't get an electric shock. This action is described by the string \". w\" (without quotes), in which \".\" is a dot (ASCII-code 46), and *w* is the word that Valentin said. 1.  Valentin pronounced some word and got an electric shock. This action is described by the string \"! w\" (without quotes), in which \"!\" is an exclamation mark (ASCII-code 33), and *w* is the word that Valentin said. 1.  Valentin made a guess about the selected letter. This action is described by the string \"? s\" (without quotes), in which \"?\" is a question mark (ASCII-code 63), and *s* is the guess\u00a0\u2014 a lowercase English letter. \nAll words consist only of lowercase English letters. The total length of all words does not exceed 105.\n\nIt is guaranteed that last action is a guess about the selected letter. Also, it is guaranteed that Valentin didn't make correct guesses about the selected letter before the last action. Moreover, it's guaranteed that if Valentin got an electric shock after pronouncing some word, then it contains the selected letter; and also if Valentin didn't get an electric shock after pronouncing some word, then it does not contain the selected letter.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of electric shocks that Valentin could have avoided if he had told the selected letter just after it became uniquely determined.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5\\n! abc\\n. ad\\n. b\\n! cd\\n? c\\n', '8\\n! hello\\n! codeforces\\n? c\\n. o\\n? d\\n? h\\n. l\\n? e\\n', '7\\n! ababahalamaha\\n? a\\n? b\\n? a\\n? b\\n? a\\n? h\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '2\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first test case after the first action it becomes clear that the selected letter is one of the following: *a*,\u2009*b*,\u2009*c*. After the second action we can note that the selected letter is not *a*. Valentin tells word \"b\" and doesn't get a shock. After that it is clear that the selected letter is *c*, but Valentin pronounces the word *cd* and gets an excessive electric shock. \n\nIn the second test case after the first two electric shocks we understand that the selected letter is *e* or *o*. Valentin tries some words consisting of these letters and after the second word it's clear that the selected letter is *e*, but Valentin makes 3 more actions before he makes a correct hypothesis.\n\nIn the third example the selected letter can be uniquely determined only when Valentin guesses it, so he didn't get excessive electric shocks.",

Finally, Natasha sat in the rocket. She flies, flies... but gets bored. She wishes to arrive to Mars already! So she decides to find something to occupy herself. She couldn't think of anything better to do than to calculate the distance to the red planet.\n\nLet's define $x$ as the distance to Mars. Unfortunately, Natasha does not know $x$. But it is known that $1 \\le x \\le m$, where Natasha knows the number $m$. Besides, $x$ and $m$ are positive integers.\n\nNatasha can ask the rocket questions.

Each element of the sequence is either $0$ or $1$. The rocket processes this sequence in the cyclic order, that is $1$-st element, $2$-nd, $3$-rd, $\\ldots$, $(n-1)$-th, $n$-th, $1$-st, $2$-nd, $3$-rd, $\\ldots$, $(n-1)$-th, $n$-th, $\\ldots$.

Each problem is denoted by its difficulty \u2014 a positive integer number. Difficulties are measured the same across all the judges (the problem with difficulty *d* on Decoforces is as hard as the problem with difficulty *d* on any other judge). \n\nMakes has chosen *n* problems to solve on Decoforces with difficulties *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. He can solve these problems in arbitrary order. Though he can solve problem *i* with difficulty *a**i* only if he had already solved some problem with difficulty  (no matter on what online judge was it).\n\nBefore starting this chosen list of problems, Makes has already solved problems with maximum difficulty *k*.\n\nWith given conditions it's easy to see that Makes sometimes can't solve all the chosen problems, no matter what order he chooses. So he wants to solve some problems on other judges to finish solving problems from his list. \n\nFor every positive integer *y* there exist some problem with difficulty *y* on at least one judge besides Decoforces.\n\nMakes can solve problems on any judge at any time, it isn't necessary to do problems from the chosen list one right after another.\n\nMakes doesn't have too much free time, so he asked you to calculate the minimum number of problems he should solve on other judges in order to solve all the chosen problems from Decoforces.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integer numbers *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=103, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=109).\n\nThe second line contains *n* space-separated integer numbers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint minimum number of problems Makes should solve on other judges in order to solve all chosen problems on Decoforces.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 3\\n2 1 9\\n', '4 20\\n10 3 6 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example Makes at first solves problems 1 and 2. Then in order to solve the problem with difficulty 9, he should solve problem with difficulty no less than 5. The only available are difficulties 5 and 6 on some other judge. Solving any of these will give Makes opportunity to solve problem 3.\n\nIn the second example he can solve every problem right from the start.",

He ran over the straight road with the signs of four types.\n -  speed limit: this sign comes with a positive integer number \u2014 maximal speed of the car after the sign (cancel the action of the previous sign of this type); -  overtake is allowed: this sign means that after some car meets it, it can overtake any other car; -  no speed limit: this sign cancels speed limit if any (car can move with arbitrary speed after this sign); -  no overtake allowed: some car can't overtake any other car after this sign. \nPolycarp goes past the signs consequentially, each new sign cancels the action of all the previous signs of it's kind (speed limit/overtake). It is possible that two or more \"no overtake allowed\" signs go one after another with zero \"overtake is allowed\" signs between them. It works with \"no speed limit\" and \"overtake is allowed\" signs as well.\n\nIn the beginning of the ride overtake is allowed and there is no speed limit.\n\nYou are given the sequence of events in chronological order \u2014 events which happened to Polycarp during the ride. There are events of following types:\n 1.  Polycarp changes the speed of his car to specified (this event comes with a positive integer number); 1.  Polycarp's car overtakes the other car; 1.  Polycarp's car goes past the \"speed limit\" sign (this sign comes with a positive integer); 1.  Polycarp's car goes past the \"overtake is allowed\" sign; 1.  Polycarp's car goes past the \"no speed limit\"; 1.  Polycarp's car goes past the \"no overtake allowed\"; \nIt is guaranteed that the first event in chronological order is the event of type 1 (Polycarp changed the speed of his car to specified).\n\nAfter the exam Polycarp can justify his rule violations by telling the driving instructor that he just didn't notice some of the signs. What is the minimal number of signs Polycarp should say he didn't notice, so that he would make no rule violations from his point of view?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains one integer number *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105) \u2014 number of events.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines starts with integer *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=6) \u2014 the type of the event.\n\nAn integer *s* (1<=\u2264<=*s*<=\u2264<=300) follows in the query of the first and the third type (if it is the query of first type, then it's new speed of Polycarp's car, if it is the query of third type, then it's new speed limit).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the first event in chronological order is the event of type 1 (Polycarp changed the speed of his car to specified).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the minimal number of road signs Polycarp should say he didn't notice, so that he would make no rule violations from his point of view.\n\nDemo Input:\n['11\\n1 100\\n3 70\\n4\\n2\\n3 120\\n5\\n3 120\\n6\\n1 150\\n4\\n3 300\\n', '5\\n1 100\\n3 200\\n2\\n4\\n5\\n', '7\\n1 20\\n2\\n6\\n4\\n6\\n6\\n2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '0\\n', '2\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example Polycarp should say he didn't notice the \"speed limit\" sign with the limit of 70 and the second \"speed limit\" sign with the limit of 120.\n\nIn the second example Polycarp didn't make any rule violation.\n\nIn the third example Polycarp should say he didn't notice both \"no overtake allowed\" that came after \"overtake is allowed\" sign.",

        "prompt": "Title: Headquarters\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nSensation, sensation in the two-dimensional kingdom! The police have caught a highly dangerous outlaw, member of the notorious \"Pihters\" gang. The law department states that the outlaw was driving from the gang's headquarters in his car when he crashed into an ice cream stall. The stall, the car, and the headquarters each occupies exactly one point on the two-dimensional kingdom.\n\nThe outlaw's car was equipped with a GPS transmitter. The transmitter showed that the car made exactly *n* movements on its way from the headquarters to the stall. A movement can move the car from point (*x*,<=*y*) to one of these four points: to point (*x*<=-<=1,<=*y*) which we will mark by letter \"L\", to point (*x*<=+<=1,<=*y*) \u2014 \"R\", to point (*x*,<=*y*<=-<=1) \u2014 \"D\", to point (*x*,<=*y*<=+<=1) \u2014 \"U\".\n\nThe GPS transmitter is very inaccurate and it doesn't preserve the exact sequence of the car's movements. Instead, it keeps records of the car's possible movements. Each record is a string of one of these types: \"UL\", \"UR\", \"DL\", \"DR\" or \"ULDR\". Each such string means that the car made a single movement corresponding to one of the characters of the string. For example, string \"UL\" means that the car moved either \"U\", or \"L\".\n\nYou've received the journal with the outlaw's possible movements from the headquarters to the stall. The journal records are given in a chronological order. Given that the ice-cream stall is located at point (0,<=0), your task is to print the number of different points that can contain the gang headquarters (that is, the number of different possible locations of the car's origin).\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of the car's movements from the headquarters to the stall.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines describes the car's possible movements. It is guaranteed that each possible movement is one of the following strings: \"UL\", \"UR\", \"DL\", \"DR\" or \"ULDR\". \n\nAll movements are given in chronological order. \n\nPlease do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin and cout stream or the %I64d specifier.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of different possible locations of the gang's headquarters.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\nUR\\nUL\\nULDR\\n', '2\\nDR\\nDL\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['9\\n', '4\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe figure below shows the nine possible positions of the gang headquarters from the first sample: \n\nFor example, the following movements can get the car from point (1,\u20090) to point (0,\u20090):",

For now the car repair shop is very small and only one car can be repaired at a given time.\n\nPolycarp is good at marketing, so he has already collected *n* requests from clients. The requests are numbered from 1 to *n* in order they came.\n\nThe *i*-th request is characterized by two values: *s**i* \u2014 the day when a client wants to start the repair of his car, *d**i* \u2014 duration (in days) to repair the car. The days are enumerated from 1, the first day is tomorrow, the second day is the day after tomorrow and so on.\n\nPolycarp is making schedule by processing requests in the order from the first to the *n*-th request. He schedules the *i*-th request as follows:\n -  If the car repair shop is idle for *d**i* days starting from *s**i* (*s**i*,<=*s**i*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*s**i*<=+<=*d**i*<=-<=1), then these days are used to repair a car of the *i*-th client. -  Otherwise, Polycarp finds the first day *x* (from 1 and further) that there are *d**i* subsequent days when no repair is scheduled starting from *x*. In other words he chooses the smallest positive *x* that all days *x*,<=*x*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*x*<=+<=*d**i*<=-<=1 are not scheduled for repair of any car. So, the car of the *i*-th client will be repaired in the range [*x*,<=*x*<=+<=*d**i*<=-<=1]. It is possible that the day *x* when repair is scheduled to start will be less than *s**i*. \nGiven *n* requests, you are asked to help Polycarp schedule all of them according to the rules above.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200) \u2014 the number of requests from clients.\n\nThe following *n* lines contain requests, one request per line. The *i*-th request is given as the pair of integers *s**i*,<=*d**i* (1<=\u2264<=*s**i*<=\u2264<=109, 1<=\u2264<=*d**i*<=\u2264<=5\u00b7106), where *s**i* is the preferred time to start repairing the *i*-th car, *d**i* is the number of days to repair the *i*-th car.\n\nThe requests should be processed in the order they are given in the input.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *n* lines. The *i*-th line should contain two integers \u2014 the start day to repair the *i*-th car and the finish day to repair the *i*-th car.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n9 2\\n7 3\\n2 4\\n', '4\\n1000000000 1000000\\n1000000000 1000000\\n100000000 1000000\\n1000000000 1000000\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['9 10\\n1 3\\n4 7\\n', '1000000000 1000999999\\n1 1000000\\n100000000 100999999\\n1000001 2000000\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

There are *n* hobbits living in the Shire. They decided to organize the Greatest Party (GP) that would last for several days. Next day the hobbits wrote a guest list, some non-empty set containing all the inhabitants of the Shire. To ensure that everybody enjoy themselves and nobody gets bored, for any two days (say, days A and B) of the GP there existed at least one hobbit, invited to come on day A and on day B. However, to ensure that nobody has a row, for any three different days A, B, C there shouldn't be a hobbit invited on days A, B and C. The Shire inhabitants are keen on keeping the GP going for as long as possible. Your task is given number *n*, to indicate the GP's maximum duration and the guest lists for each day.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=10000), representing the number of hobbits.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first output line print a number *k* \u2014 the maximum duration of GP in days.

        "prompt": "Title: Petya's Exams\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nPetya studies at university. The current academic year finishes with $n$ special days. Petya needs to pass $m$ exams in those special days. The special days in this problem are numbered from $1$ to $n$.\n\nThere are three values about each exam:\n -  $s_i$ \u2014 the day, when questions for the $i$-th exam will be published, -  $d_i$ \u2014 the day of the $i$-th exam ($s_i &lt; d_i$), -  $c_i$ \u2014 number of days Petya needs to prepare for the $i$-th exam. For the $i$-th exam Petya should prepare in days between $s_i$ and $d_i-1$, inclusive. \nThere are three types of activities for Petya in each day: to spend a day doing nothing (taking a rest), to spend a day passing exactly one exam or to spend a day preparing for exactly one exam. So he can't pass/prepare for multiple exams in a day. He can't mix his activities in a day. If he is preparing for the $i$-th exam in day $j$, then $s_i \\le j &lt; d_i$.\n\nIt is allowed to have breaks in a preparation to an exam and to alternate preparations for different exams in consecutive days. So preparation for an exam is not required to be done in consecutive days.\n\nFind the schedule for Petya to prepare for all exams and pass them, or report that it is impossible.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ $(2 \\le n \\le 100, 1 \\le m \\le n)$ \u2014 the number of days and the number of exams.\n\nEach of the following $m$ lines contains three integers $s_i$, $d_i$, $c_i$ $(1 \\le s_i &lt; d_i \\le n, 1 \\le c_i \\le n)$ \u2014 the day, when questions for the $i$-th exam will be given, the day of the $i$-th exam, number of days Petya needs to prepare for the $i$-th exam. \n\nGuaranteed, that all the exams will be in different days. Questions for different exams can be given in the same day. It is possible that, in the day of some exam, the questions for other exams are given.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf Petya can not prepare and pass all the exams, print -1. In case of positive answer, print $n$ integers, where the $j$-th number is:\n -  $(m + 1)$, if the $j$-th day is a day of some exam (recall that in each day no more than one exam is conducted), -  zero, if in the $j$-th day Petya will have a rest, -  $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le m$), if Petya will prepare for the $i$-th exam in the day $j$ (the total number of days Petya prepares for each exam should be strictly equal to the number of days needed to prepare for it).Assume that the exams are numbered in order of appearing in the input, starting from $1$.If there are multiple schedules, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 2\\n1 3 1\\n1 5 1\\n', '3 2\\n1 3 1\\n1 2 1\\n', '10 3\\n4 7 2\\n1 10 3\\n8 9 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1 2 3 0 3 \\n', '-1\\n', '2 2 2 1 1 0 4 3 4 4 \\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example Petya can, for example, prepare for exam $1$ in the first day, prepare for exam $2$ in the second day, pass exam $1$ in the third day, relax in the fourth day, and pass exam $2$ in the fifth day. So, he can prepare and pass all exams.\n\nIn the second example, there are three days and two exams. So, Petya can prepare in only one day (because in two other days he should pass exams).

This time he decided to build his own high-speed Internet exchange point. It should consist of *n* nodes connected with minimum possible number of wires into one network (a wire directly connects two nodes). Exactly *k* of the nodes should be exit-nodes, that means that each of them should be connected to exactly one other node of the network, while all other nodes should be connected to at least two nodes in order to increase the system stability.\n\nArkady wants to make the system as fast as possible, so he wants to minimize the maximum distance between two exit-nodes. The distance between two nodes is the number of wires a package needs to go through between those two nodes.\n\nHelp Arkady to find such a way to build the network that the distance between the two most distant exit-nodes is as small as possible.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105, 2<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1)\u00a0\u2014 the total number of nodes and the number of exit-nodes.\n\nNote that it is always possible to build at least one network with *n* nodes and *k* exit-nodes within the given constraints.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print the minimum possible distance between the two most distant exit-nodes. In each of the next *n*<=-<=1 lines print two integers: the ids of the nodes connected by a wire. The description of each wire should be printed exactly once. You can print wires and wires' ends in arbitrary order. The nodes should be numbered from 1 to *n*. Exit-nodes can have any ids.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 2\\n', '5 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n', '3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n3 5\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example the only network is shown on the left picture.\n\nIn the second example one of optimal networks is shown on the right picture.\n\nExit-nodes are highlighted.",

For each day we know the forecast for the average air temperature that day. \n\nVasya has a new set of winter tires which allows him to drive safely no more than *k* days at any average air temperature. After *k* days of using it (regardless of the temperature of these days) the set of winter tires wears down and cannot be used more. It is not necessary that these *k* days form a continuous segment of days.\n\nBefore the first winter day Vasya still uses summer tires. It is possible to drive safely on summer tires any number of days when the average air temperature is non-negative. It is impossible to drive on summer tires at days when the average air temperature is negative. \n\nVasya can change summer tires to winter tires and vice versa at the beginning of any day.\n\nFind the minimum number of times Vasya needs to change summer tires to winter tires and vice versa to drive safely during the winter. At the end of the winter the car can be with any set of tires.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two positive integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of winter days and the number of days winter tires can be used.

Thus, the total number of tires' changes equals two. \n\nIn the second example before the first winter day Vasya should change summer tires to winter tires, and then after the first winter day change winter tires to summer tires.

        "prompt": "Title: Defragmentation\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIn this problem you have to implement an algorithm to defragment your hard disk. The hard disk consists of a sequence of clusters, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*. The disk has *m* recorded files, the *i*-th file occupies clusters with numbers *a**i*,<=1, *a**i*,<=2, ..., *a**i*,<=*n**i*. These clusters are not necessarily located consecutively on the disk, but the order in which they are given corresponds to their sequence in the file (cluster *a**i*,<=1 contains the first fragment of the *i*-th file, cluster *a**i*,<=2 has the second fragment, etc.). Also the disc must have one or several clusters which are free from files.\n\nYou are permitted to perform operations of copying the contents of cluster number *i* to cluster number *j* (*i* and *j* must be different). Moreover, if the cluster number *j* used to keep some information, it is lost forever. Clusters are not cleaned, but after the defragmentation is complete, some of them are simply declared unusable (although they may possibly still contain some fragments of files).\n\nYour task is to use a sequence of copy operations to ensure that each file occupies a contiguous area of memory. Each file should occupy a consecutive cluster section, the files must follow one after another from the beginning of the hard disk. After defragmentation all free (unused) clusters should be at the end of the hard disk. After defragmenting files can be placed in an arbitrary order. Clusters of each file should go consecutively from first to last. See explanatory examples in the notes.\n\nPrint the sequence of operations leading to the disk defragmentation. Note that you do not have to minimize the number of operations, but it should not exceed 2*n*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=200) \u2014 the number of clusters and the number of files, correspondingly. Next *m* lines contain descriptions of the files. The first number in the line is *n**i* (*n**i*<=\u2265<=1), the number of clusters occupied by the *i*-th file. Then follow *n**i* numbers *a**i*,<=1, *a**i*,<=2, ..., *a**i*,<=*n**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*). It is guaranteed that each cluster number occurs not more than once and , that is, there exists at least one unused cluster. Numbers on each line are separated by spaces.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print a single integer *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=2*n*) \u2014 the number of operations needed to defragment the disk. Next *k* lines should contain the operations' descriptions as \"*i* *j*\" (copy the contents of the cluster number *i* to the cluster number *j*).\n\nDemo Input:\n['7 2\\n2 1 2\\n3 3 4 5\\n', '7 2\\n2 1 3\\n3 2 4 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0\\n', '3\\n2 6\\n3 2\\n6 3\\n']\n\nNote:\nLet's say that a disk consists of 8 clusters and contains two files. The first file occupies two clusters and the second file occupies three clusters.

Firstly Alice chooses some color *A*, then Bob chooses some color *B* (*A*<=\u2260<=*B*). After each car they update the number of cars of their chosen color that have run past them. Let's define this numbers after *i*-th car *cnt**A*(*i*) and *cnt**B*(*i*).\n -  If *cnt**A*(*i*)<=&gt;<=*cnt**B*(*i*) for every *i* then the winner is Alice. -  If *cnt**B*(*i*)<=\u2265<=*cnt**A*(*i*) for every *i* then the winner is Bob. -  Otherwise it's a draw. \nBob knows all the colors of cars that they will encounter and order of their appearance.

Initially, Kolya creates a string *s*, consisting of small English letters, and uniformly at random chooses an integer *k* from a segment [0,<=*len*(*s*)<=-<=1]. He tells Vasya this string *s*, and then shifts it *k* letters to the left, i.\u00a0e. creates a new string *t*<==<=*s**k*<=+<=1*s**k*<=+<=2... *s**n**s*1*s*2... *s**k*. Vasya does not know the integer *k* nor the string *t*, but he wants to guess the integer *k*. To do this, he asks Kolya to tell him the first letter of the new string, and then, after he sees it, open one more letter on some position, which Vasya can choose.\n\nVasya understands, that he can't guarantee that he will win, but he wants to know the probability of winning, if he plays optimally. He wants you to compute this probability. \n\nNote that Vasya wants to know the value of *k* uniquely, it means, that if there are at least two cyclic shifts of *s* that fit the information Vasya knowns, Vasya loses. Of course, at any moment of the game Vasya wants to maximize the probability of his win.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe only string contains the string *s* of length *l* (3<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=5000), consisting of small English letters only.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the only number\u00a0\u2014 the answer for the problem.

        "prompt": "Title: Efim and Strange Grade\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nEfim just received his grade for the last test. He studies in a special school and his grade can be equal to any positive decimal fraction. First he got disappointed, as he expected a way more pleasant result. Then, he developed a tricky plan. Each second, he can ask his teacher to round the grade at any place after the decimal point (also, he can ask to round to the nearest integer). \n\nThere are *t* seconds left till the end of the break, so Efim has to act fast. Help him find what is the maximum grade he can get in no more than *t* seconds. Note, that he can choose to not use all *t* seconds. Moreover, he can even choose to not round the grade at all.\n\nIn this problem, classic rounding rules are used: while rounding number to the *n*-th digit one has to take a look at the digit *n*<=+<=1. If it is less than 5 than the *n*-th digit remain unchanged while all subsequent digits are replaced with 0. Otherwise, if the *n*<=+<=1 digit is greater or equal to 5, the digit at the position *n* is increased by 1 (this might also change some other digits, if this one was equal to 9) and all subsequent digits are replaced with 0. At the end, all trailing zeroes are thrown away.\n\nFor example, if the number 1.14 is rounded to the first decimal place, the result is 1.1, while if we round 1.5 to the nearest integer, the result is 2. Rounding number 1.299996121 in the fifth decimal place will result in number 1.3.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *t* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 the length of Efim's grade and the number of seconds till the end of the break respectively.\n\nThe second line contains the grade itself. It's guaranteed that the grade is a positive number, containing at least one digit after the decimal points, and it's representation doesn't finish with 0.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the maximum grade that Efim can get in *t* seconds. Do not print trailing zeroes.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6 1\\n10.245\\n', '6 2\\n10.245\\n', '3 100\\n9.2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['10.25\\n', '10.3\\n', '9.2\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first two samples Efim initially has grade 10.245. \n\nDuring the first second Efim can obtain grade 10.25, and then 10.3 during the next second. Note, that the answer 10.30 will be considered incorrect.\n\nIn the third sample the optimal strategy is to not perform any rounding at all.",

Now there is a single travel card for all transport. To make a trip a passenger scan his card and then he is charged according to the fare.\n\nThe fare is constructed in the following manner. There are three types of tickets: \n 1.  a ticket for one trip costs 20 byteland rubles, 1.  a ticket for 90 minutes costs 50 byteland rubles, 1.  a ticket for one day (1440 minutes) costs 120 byteland rubles. \nNote that a ticket for *x* minutes activated at time *t* can be used for trips started in time range from *t* to *t*<=+<=*x*<=-<=1, inclusive. Assume that all trips take exactly one minute.\n\nTo simplify the choice for the passenger, the system automatically chooses the optimal tickets. After each trip starts, the system analyses all the previous trips and the current trip and chooses a set of tickets for these trips with a minimum total cost. Let the minimum total cost of tickets to cover all trips from the first to the current is *a*, and the total sum charged before is *b*. Then the system charges the passenger the sum *a*<=-<=*b*.\n\nYou have to write a program that, for given trips made by a passenger, calculates the sum the passenger is charged after each trip.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains integer number *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of trips made by passenger.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains the time of trip *t**i* (0<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=109), measured in minutes from the time of starting the system. All *t**i* are different, given in ascending order, i.\u00a0e. *t**i*<=+<=1<=&gt;<=*t**i* holds for all 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*n*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput *n* integers. For each trip, print the sum the passenger is charged after it.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n', '10\\n13\\n45\\n46\\n60\\n103\\n115\\n126\\n150\\n256\\n516\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['20\\n20\\n10\\n', '20\\n20\\n10\\n0\\n20\\n0\\n0\\n20\\n20\\n10\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example, the system works as follows: for the first and second trips it is cheaper to pay for two one-trip tickets, so each time 20 rubles is charged, after the third trip the system understands that it would be cheaper to buy a ticket for 90 minutes. This ticket costs 50 rubles, and the passenger had already paid 40 rubles, so it is necessary to charge 10 rubles only.",

        "prompt": "Title: Military Problem\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIn this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \\le u_i, k_i \\le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print \"-1\" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.\n\nYou should process queries independently. They do not affect each other.\n\nDemo Input:\n['9 6\\n1 1 1 3 5 3 5 7\\n3 1\\n1 5\\n3 4\\n7 3\\n1 8\\n1 9\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n6\\n8\\n-1\\n9\\n4\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

However, sometimes they argue over little things. Recently, they started a new company, but they are having trouble finding a name for the company.\n\nTo settle this problem, they've decided to play a game. The company name will consist of *n* letters. Oleg and Igor each have a set of *n* letters (which might contain multiple copies of the same letter, the sets can be different). Initially, the company name is denoted by *n* question marks. Oleg and Igor takes turns to play the game, Oleg moves first. In each turn, a player can choose one of the letters *c* in his set and replace any of the question marks with *c*. Then, a copy of the letter *c* is removed from his set. The game ends when all the question marks has been replaced by some letter.\n\nFor example, suppose Oleg has the set of letters {*i*,<=*o*,<=*i*} and Igor has the set of letters {*i*,<=*m*,<=*o*}. One possible game is as follows :\n\nInitially, the company name is ???.\n\nOleg replaces the second question mark with 'i'. The company name becomes ?i?. The set of letters Oleg have now is {*i*,<=*o*}.\n\nIgor replaces the third question mark with 'o'. The company name becomes ?io. The set of letters Igor have now is {*i*,<=*m*}.\n\nFinally, Oleg replaces the first question mark with 'o'. The company name becomes oio. The set of letters Oleg have now is {*i*}.\n\nIn the end, the company name is oio.\n\nOleg wants the company name to be as lexicographically small as possible while Igor wants the company name to be as lexicographically large as possible. What will be the company name if Oleg and Igor always play optimally?\n\nA string *s*<==<=*s*1*s*2...*s**m* is called lexicographically smaller than a string *t*<==<=*t*1*t*2...*t**m* (where *s*<=\u2260<=*t*) if *s**i*<=&lt;<=*t**i* where *i* is the smallest index such that *s**i*<=\u2260<=*t**i*.

Each actor has a personal identifier \u2014 an integer from 1 to *m* (distinct actors have distinct identifiers). Vasya likes to watch Berland movies with Berland actors, and he has *k* favorite actors. He watched the movie trailers for the next month and wrote the following information for every movie: the movie title, the number of actors who starred in it, and the identifiers of these actors. Besides, he managed to copy the movie titles and how many actors starred there, but he didn't manage to write down the identifiers of some actors. Vasya looks at his records and wonders which movies may be his favourite, and which ones may not be. Once Vasya learns the exact cast of all movies, his favorite movies will be determined as follows: a movie becomes favorite movie, if no other movie from Vasya's list has more favorite actors.\n\nHelp the boy to determine the following for each movie:\n-  whether it surely will be his favourite movie;-  whether it surely won't be his favourite movie; -  can either be favourite or not.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers *m* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*m*) \u2014 the number of actors in Berland and the number of Vasya's favourite actors. \n\nThe second line contains *k* distinct integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*m*) \u2014 the identifiers of Vasya's favourite actors.\n\nThe third line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of movies in Vasya's list.\n\nThen follow *n* blocks of lines, each block contains a movie's description.

In fact, she has spent so much time there that she now runs the place! Her job is to buy books and keep them at the library so that people can borrow and read them. There are *n* different books, numbered 1 through *n*.\n\nWe will look at the library's operation during *n* consecutive days. Heidi knows in advance that on the *i*-th day (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) precisely one person will come to the library, request to borrow the book *a**i*, read it in a few hours, and return the book later on the same day.\n\nHeidi desperately wants to please all her guests, so she will make sure to always have the book *a**i* available in the library on the *i*-th day. During the night before the *i*-th day, she has the option of going to the bookstore (which operates at nights to avoid competition with the library) and buying any book for the price of 1 CHF. Of course, if she already has a book at the library, she does not need to buy it again. Initially, the library contains no books.\n\nThere is a problem, though. The capacity of the library is *k* \u2013 this means that at any time, there can be at most *k* books at the library. If buying a new book would cause Heidi to have more than *k* books, she must first get rid of some book that she already has, in order to make room for the new book. If she later needs a book that she got rid of, she will need to buy that book again.\n\nYou are given *k* and the sequence of requests for books *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. What is the minimum cost (in CHF) of buying new books to satisfy all the requests?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input will contain two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=80). The second line will contain *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2013 the sequence of book requests.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOn a single line print the minimum cost of buying books at the store so as to satisfy all requests.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 80\\n1 2 2 1\\n', '4 1\\n1 2 2 1\\n', '4 2\\n1 2 3 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '3\\n', '3\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first test case, Heidi is able to keep all books forever. Therefore, she only needs to buy the book 1 before the first day and the book 2 before the second day.\n\nIn the second test case, she can only keep one book at a time. Therefore she will need to buy new books on the first, second and fourth day.\n\nIn the third test case, before buying book 3 on the third day, she must decide which of the books 1 and 2 she should get rid of. Of course, she should keep the book 1, which will be requested on the fourth day.",

        "prompt": "Title: Hit Ball\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nWhen Valera was playing football on a stadium, it suddenly began to rain. Valera hid in the corridor under the grandstand not to get wet. However, the desire to play was so great that he decided to train his hitting the ball right in this corridor. Valera went back far enough, put the ball and hit it. The ball bounced off the walls, the ceiling and the floor corridor and finally hit the exit door. As the ball was wet, it left a spot on the door. Now Valera wants to know the coordinates for this spot.\n\nLet's describe the event more formally. The ball will be considered a point in space. The door of the corridor will be considered a rectangle located on plane *xOz*, such that the lower left corner of the door is located at point (0,<=0,<=0), and the upper right corner is located at point (*a*,<=0,<=*b*) . The corridor will be considered as a rectangular parallelepiped, infinite in the direction of increasing coordinates of *y*. In this corridor the floor will be considered as plane *xOy*, and the ceiling as plane, parallel to *xOy* and passing through point (*a*,<=0,<=*b*). We will also assume that one of the walls is plane *yOz*, and the other wall is plane, parallel to *yOz* and passing through point (*a*,<=0,<=*b*).\n\nWe'll say that the ball hit the door when its coordinate *y* was equal to 0. Thus the coordinates of the spot are point (*x*0,<=0,<=*z*0), where 0<=\u2264<=*x*0<=\u2264<=*a*,<=0<=\u2264<=*z*0<=\u2264<=*b*. To hit the ball, Valera steps away from the door at distance *m* and puts the ball in the center of the corridor at point . After the hit the ball flies at speed (*v**x*,<=*v**y*,<=*v**z*). This means that if the ball has coordinates (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*), then after one second it will have coordinates (*x*<=+<=*v**x*,<=*y*<=+<=*v**y*,<=*z*<=+<=*v**z*).\n\nSee image in notes for clarification.\n\nWhen the ball collides with the ceiling, the floor or a wall of the corridor, it bounces off in accordance with the laws of reflection (the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection). In the problem we consider the ideal physical model, so we can assume that there is no air resistance, friction force, or any loss of energy.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers *a*,<=*b*,<=*m* (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100). The first two integers specify point (*a*,<=0,<=*b*), through which the ceiling and one of the corridor walls pass.

        "prompt": "Title: Multi-core Processor\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe research center Q has developed a new multi-core processor. The processor consists of *n* cores and has *k* cells of cache memory. Consider the work of this processor.\n\nAt each cycle each core of the processor gets one instruction: either do nothing, or the number of the memory cell (the core will write an information to the cell). After receiving the command, the core executes it immediately. Sometimes it happens that at one cycle, multiple cores try to write the information into a single cell. Unfortunately, the developers did not foresee the possibility of resolving conflicts between cores, so in this case there is a deadlock: all these cores and the corresponding memory cell are locked forever. Each of the locked cores ignores all further commands, and no core in the future will be able to record an information into the locked cell. If any of the cores tries to write an information into some locked cell, it is immediately locked.\n\nThe development team wants to explore the deadlock situation. Therefore, they need a program that will simulate the processor for a given set of instructions for each core within *m* cycles . You're lucky, this interesting work is entrusted to you. According to the instructions, during the *m* cycles define for each core the number of the cycle, during which it will become locked. It is believed that initially all cores and all memory cells are not locked.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=100). Then follow *n* lines describing instructions. The *i*-th line contains *m* integers: *x**i*1,<=*x**i*2,<=...,<=*x**im* (0<=\u2264<=*x**ij*<=\u2264<=*k*), where *x**ij* is the instruction that must be executed by the *i*-th core at the *j*-th cycle. If *x**ij* equals 0, then the corresponding instruction is \u00abdo nothing\u00bb. But if *x**ij* is a number from 1 to *k*, then the corresponding instruction is \u00abwrite information to the memory cell number *x**ij*\u00bb.\n\nWe assume that the cores are numbered from 1 to *n*, the work cycles are numbered from 1 to *m* and the memory cells are numbered from 1 to *k*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *n* lines. In the *i*-th line print integer *t**i*. This number should be equal to 0 if the *i*-th core won't be locked, or it should be equal to the number of the cycle when this core will be locked.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 3 5\\n1 0 0\\n1 0 2\\n2 3 1\\n3 2 0\\n', '3 2 2\\n1 2\\n1 2\\n2 2\\n', '1 1 1\\n0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n1\\n3\\n0\\n', '1\\n1\\n0\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

Three teams are participating in it. Currently *k* games had already been played. \n\nYou are an avid football fan, but recently you missed the whole *k* games. Fortunately, you remember a guess of your friend for these *k* games. Your friend did not tell exact number of wins of each team, instead he thought that absolute difference between number of wins of first and second team will be *d*1 and that of between second and third team will be *d*2.\n\nYou don't want any of team win the tournament, that is each team should have the same number of wins after *n* games. That's why you want to know: does there exist a valid tournament satisfying the friend's guess such that no team will win this tournament?\n\nNote that outcome of a match can not be a draw, it has to be either win or loss.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer corresponding to number of test cases *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=105).\n\nEach of the next *t* lines will contain four space-separated integers *n*,<=*k*,<=*d*1,<=*d*2 (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1012;\u00a00<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*;\u00a00<=\u2264<=*d*1,<=*d*2<=\u2264<=*k*) \u2014 data for the current test case.\n\nOutput Specification:\nFor each test case, output a single line containing either \"yes\" if it is possible to have no winner of tournament, or \"no\" otherwise (without quotes).\n\nDemo Input:\n['5\\n3 0 0 0\\n3 3 0 0\\n6 4 1 0\\n6 3 3 0\\n3 3 3 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['yes\\nyes\\nyes\\nno\\nno\\n']\n\nNote:\nSample 1.

As *d*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>\u2009=\u20090 and *d*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009=\u20090, and there is a way to play three games with no winner of tournament (described in the previous sample), the answer is \"yes\".\n\nSample 3. You missed 4 matches, and *d*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>\u2009=\u20091,\u2009*d*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009=\u20090. These four matches can be: 1-2 (win 2), 1-3 (win 3), 1-2 (win 1), 1-3 (win 1). Currently the first team has 2 wins, the second team has 1 win, the third team has 1 win. Two remaining matches can be: 1-2 (win 2), 1-3 (win 3). In the end all the teams have equal number of wins (2 wins).",

Due this wonderful event, Petya's friends decided to give him sweets. The total number of Petya's friends equals to *n*.\n\nLet us remind you the definition of the greatest common divisor: *GCD*(*a*1,<=...,<=*a**k*)<==<=*d*, where *d* represents such a maximal positive number that each *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*k*) is evenly divisible by *d*. At that, we assume that all *a**i*'s are greater than zero.\n\nKnowing that Petya is keen on programming, his friends has agreed beforehand that the 1-st friend gives *a*1 sweets, the 2-nd one gives *a*2 sweets, ..., the *n*-th one gives *a**n* sweets. At the same time, for any *i* and *j* (1<=\u2264<=*i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*) they want the *GCD*(*a**i*,<=*a**j*) not to be equal to 1. However, they also want the following condition to be satisfied: *GCD*(*a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*)<==<=1. One more: all the *a**i* should be distinct.\n\nHelp the friends to choose the suitable numbers *a*1,<=...,<=*a**n*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf there is no answer, print \"-1\" without quotes.

Each number must consist of not more than 100 digits, and must not contain any leading zeros. If there are several solutions to that problem, print any of them.\n\nDo not forget, please, that all of the following conditions must be true:\n-  For every *i* and *j* (1<=\u2264<=*i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*): *GCD*(*a**i*,<=*a**j*)<=\u2260<=1-  *GCD*(*a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*)<==<=1-  For every *i* and *j* (1<=\u2264<=*i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*i*<=\u2260<=*j*): *a**i*<=\u2260<=*a**j* \nPlease, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++.

For example, string \"010\" has six substrings: \"0\", \"1\", \"0\", \"01\", \"10\", \"010\". Two substrings are considered different if their positions of occurrence are different. So, if some string occurs multiple times, we should consider it the number of times it occurs.\n\nYou are given a binary string *s*. Your task is to find the number of its substrings, containing exactly *k* characters \"1\".\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains the single integer *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106). The second line contains a non-empty binary string *s*. The length of *s* does not exceed 106 characters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the single number \u2014 the number of substrings of the given string, containing exactly *k* characters \"1\".\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++.

        "prompt": "Title: Comments\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nA rare article in the Internet is posted without a possibility to comment it. On a Polycarp's website each article has comments feed.\n\nEach comment on Polycarp's website is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters of English alphabet. Comments have tree-like structure, that means each comment except root comments (comments of the highest level) has exactly one parent comment.\n\nWhen Polycarp wants to save comments to his hard drive he uses the following format. Each comment he writes in the following format: \n -  at first, the text of the comment is written; -  after that the number of comments is written, for which this comment is a parent comment (i.\u00a0e. the number of the replies to this comments); -  after that the comments for which this comment is a parent comment are written (the writing of these comments uses the same algorithm). \nFor example, if the comments look like:\n\nthen the first comment is written as \"hello,2,ok,0,bye,0\", the second is written as \"test,0\", the third comment is written as \"one,1,two,2,a,0,b,0\". The whole comments feed is written as: \"hello,2,ok,0,bye,0,test,0,one,1,two,2,a,0,b,0\". For a given comments feed in the format specified above print the comments in a different format: \n -  at first, print a integer *d*\u00a0\u2014 the maximum depth of nesting comments; -  after that print *d* lines, the *i*-th of them corresponds to nesting level *i*; -  for the *i*-th row print comments of nesting level *i* in the order of their appearance in the Policarp's comments feed, separated by space.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains non-empty comments feed in the described format. It consists of uppercase and lowercase letters of English alphabet, digits and commas. \n\nIt is guaranteed that each comment is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase English characters. Each of the number of comments is integer (consisting of at least one digit), and either equals 0 or does not contain leading zeros.\n\nThe length of the whole string does not exceed 106. It is guaranteed that given structure of comments is valid.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint comments in a format that is given in the statement. For each level of nesting, comments should be printed in the order they are given in the input.\n\nDemo Input:\n['hello,2,ok,0,bye,0,test,0,one,1,two,2,a,0,b,0\\n', 'a,5,A,0,a,0,A,0,a,0,A,0\\n', 'A,3,B,2,C,0,D,1,E,0,F,1,G,0,H,1,I,1,J,0,K,1,L,0,M,2,N,0,O,1,P,0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\nhello test one \\nok bye two \\na b \\n', '2\\na \\nA a A a A \\n', '4\\nA K M \\nB F H L N O \\nC D G I P \\nE J \\n']\n\nNote:\nThe first example is explained in the statements.",

On his arrival, Sam tells him that he wants to go to Oldtown to train at the Citadel to become a maester, so he can return and take the deceased Aemon's place as maester of Castle Black. Jon agrees to Sam's proposal and Sam sets off his journey to the Citadel. However becoming a trainee at the Citadel is not a cakewalk and hence the maesters at the Citadel gave Sam a problem to test his eligibility. \n\nInitially Sam has a list with a single element *n*. Then he has to perform certain operations on this list. In each operation Sam must remove any element *x*, such that *x*<=&gt;<=1, from the list and insert at the same position , ,  sequentially. He must continue with these operations until all the elements in the list are either 0 or 1.\n\nNow the masters want the total number of 1s in the range *l* to *r* (1-indexed). Sam wants to become a maester but unfortunately he cannot solve this problem.

A word can be empty: for example, the string *s*=\";;\" contains three empty words separated by ';'.\n\nYou should find all words in the given string that are nonnegative INTEGER numbers without leading zeroes and build by them new string *a*. String *a* should contain all words that are numbers separating them by ',' (the order of numbers should remain the same as in the string *s*). By all other words you should build string *b* in the same way (the order of numbers should remain the same as in the string *s*).\n\nHere strings \"101\", \"0\" are INTEGER numbers, but \"01\" and \"1.0\" are not.\n\nFor example, for the string aba,123;1a;0 the string *a* would be equal to \"123,0\" and string *b* would be equal to \"aba,1a\".\n\nInput Specification:\nThe only line of input contains the string *s* (1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=105).

It is meaningless, so Nam decided to make the string more beautiful, that is to make it be a palindrome by using 4 arrow keys: left, right, up, down.\n\nThere is a cursor pointing at some symbol of the string. Suppose that cursor is at position *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*, the string uses 1-based indexing) now. Left and right arrow keys are used to move cursor around the string. The string is cyclic, that means that when Nam presses left arrow key, the cursor will move to position *i*<=-<=1 if *i*<=&gt;<=1 or to the end of the string (i. e. position *n*) otherwise. The same holds when he presses the right arrow key (if *i*<==<=*n*, the cursor appears at the beginning of the string).\n\nWhen Nam presses up arrow key, the letter which the text cursor is pointing to will change to the next letter in English alphabet (assuming that alphabet is also cyclic, i. e. after 'z' follows 'a'). The same holds when he presses the down arrow key.\n\nInitially, the text cursor is at position *p*. \n\nBecause Nam has a lot homework to do, he wants to complete this as fast as possible. Can you help him by calculating the minimum number of arrow keys presses to make the string to be a palindrome?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) and *p* (1<=\u2264<=*p*<=\u2264<=*n*), the length of Nam's string and the initial position of the text cursor.\n\nThe next line contains *n* lowercase characters of Nam's string.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the minimum number of presses needed to change string into a palindrome.\n\nDemo Input:\n['8 3\\naeabcaez\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['6\\n']\n\nNote:\nA string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward or reversed.\n\nIn the sample test, initial Nam's string is: <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/7cd1b7b2498296406fff738215b48ddd9a12898d.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> (cursor position is shown bold).\n\nIn optimal solution, Nam may do 6 following steps:\n\nThe result, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/f998673d1ad2128f8e2de7ff01895c8ef9ee34ff.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, is now a palindrome.",

Please use the statement as a formal document and read it carefully.\n\nA string is a bHTML table, if it satisfies the grammar: \n\nBlanks in the grammar are only for purposes of illustration, in the given data there will be no spaces. The bHTML table is very similar to a simple regular HTML table in which meet only the following tags : \"table\", \"tr\", \"td\", all the tags are paired and the table contains at least one row and at least one cell in each row. Have a look at the sample tests as examples of tables.\n\nAs can be seen, the tables may be nested. You are given a table (which may contain other(s)). You need to write a program that analyzes all the tables and finds the number of cells in each of them. The tables are not required to be rectangular.\n\nInput Specification:\nFor convenience, input data can be separated into non-empty lines in an arbitrary manner. The input data consist of no more than 10 lines. Combine (concatenate) all the input lines into one, to get a text representation *s* of the specified table. String *s* corresponds to the given grammar (the root element of grammar is TABLE), its length does not exceed 5000. Only lower case letters are used to write tags.

Typically, it can produce up to *a* thimbles a day. However, some of the machinery is defective, so it can currently only produce *b* thimbles each day. The factory intends to choose a *k*-day period to do maintenance and construction; it cannot produce any thimbles during this time, but will be restored to its full production of *a* thimbles per day after the *k* days are complete.\n\nInitially, no orders are pending. The factory receives updates of the form *d**i*, *a**i*, indicating that *a**i* new orders have been placed for the *d**i*-th day. Each order requires a single thimble to be produced on precisely the specified day.

        "prompt": "Title: EKG\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIn the rush of modern life, people often forget how beautiful the world is. The time to enjoy those around them is so little that some even stand in queues to several rooms at the same time in the clinic, running from one queue to another.\n\n(Cultural note: standing in huge and disorganized queues for hours is a native tradition in Russia, dating back to the Soviet period. Queues can resemble crowds rather than lines. Not to get lost in such a queue, a person should follow a strict survival technique: you approach the queue and ask who the last person is, somebody answers and you join the crowd. Now you're the last person in the queue till somebody else shows up. You keep an eye on the one who was last before you as he is your only chance to get to your destination) I'm sure many people have had the problem when a stranger asks who the last person in the queue is and even dares to hint that he will be the last in the queue and then bolts away to some unknown destination. These are the representatives of the modern world, in which the ratio of lack of time is so great that they do not even watch foreign top-rated TV series. Such people often create problems in queues, because the newcomer does not see the last person in the queue and takes a place after the \"virtual\" link in this chain, wondering where this legendary figure has left.\n\nThe Smart Beaver has been ill and he's made an appointment with a therapist. The doctor told the Beaver the sad news in a nutshell: it is necessary to do an electrocardiogram. The next day the Smart Beaver got up early, put on the famous TV series on download (three hours till the download's complete), clenched his teeth and bravely went to join a queue to the electrocardiogram room, which is notorious for the biggest queues at the clinic.\n\nHaving stood for about three hours in the queue, the Smart Beaver realized that many beavers had not seen who was supposed to stand in the queue before them and there was a huge mess. He came up to each beaver in the ECG room queue and asked who should be in front of him in the queue. If the beaver did not know his correct position in the queue, then it might be his turn to go get an ECG, or maybe he should wait for a long, long time...\n\nAs you've guessed, the Smart Beaver was in a hurry home, so he gave you all the necessary information for you to help him to determine what his number in the queue can be.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=103) and *x* (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of beavers that stand in the queue and the Smart Beaver's number, correspondingly. All willing to get to the doctor are numbered from 1 to *n*.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of the beaver followed by the *i*-th beaver. If *a**i*<==<=0, then the *i*-th beaver doesn't know who is should be in front of him. It is guaranteed that values *a**i* are correct. That is there is no cycles in the dependencies. And any beaver is followed by at most one beaver in the queue.\n\nThe input limits for scoring 30 points are (subproblem B1): \n -  It is guaranteed that the number of zero elements *a**i* doesn't exceed 20. \nThe input limits for scoring 100 points are (subproblems B1+B2): \n -  The number of zero elements *a**i* is arbitrary.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint all possible positions of the Smart Beaver in the line in the increasing order.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6 1\\n2 0 4 0 6 0\\n', '6 2\\n2 3 0 5 6 0\\n', '4 1\\n0 0 0 0\\n', '6 2\\n0 0 1 0 4 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n4\\n6\\n', '2\\n5\\n', '1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n', '1\\n3\\n4\\n6\\n']\n\n",

        "prompt": "Title: Hyperdrive\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIn a far away galaxy there are *n* inhabited planets, numbered with numbers from 1 to *n*. They are located at large distances from each other, that's why the communication between them was very difficult until on the planet number 1 a hyperdrive was invented. As soon as this significant event took place, *n*<=-<=1 spaceships were built on the planet number 1, and those ships were sent to other planets to inform about the revolutionary invention. \n\nParadoxical thought it may be, but the hyperspace is represented as simple three-dimensional Euclidean space. The inhabited planets may be considered fixed points in it, and no two points coincide and no three points lie on the same straight line. The movement of a ship with a hyperdrive between two planets is performed along a straight line at the constant speed, the same for all the ships. That's why the distance in the hyperspace are measured in hyperyears (a ship with a hyperdrive covers a distance of *s* hyperyears in *s* years).\n\nWhen the ship reaches an inhabited planet, the inhabitants of the planet dissemble it, make *n*<=-<=2 identical to it ships with a hyperdrive and send them to other *n*<=-<=2 planets (except for the one from which the ship arrived). The time to make a new ship compared to the time in which they move from one planet to another is so small that it can be disregarded. New ships are absolutely identical to the ones sent initially: they move at the same constant speed along a straight line trajectory and, having reached a planet, perform the very same mission, i.e. are dissembled to build new *n*<=-<=2 ships and send them to all the planets except for the one from which the ship arrived. Thus, the process of spreading the important news around the galaxy continues.\n\nHowever the hyperdrive creators hurried to spread the news about their invention so much that they didn't study completely what goes on when two ships collide in the hyperspace. If two moving ships find themselves at one point, they provoke an explosion of colossal power, leading to the destruction of the galaxy!\n\nYour task is to find the time the galaxy will continue to exist from the moment of the ships' launch from the first planet.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a number *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5000) \u2014 the number of inhabited planets in the galaxy.

He even types numeric sequences carefully, unlike his classmates. If he sees a sequence without a space after the comma, with two spaces in a row, or when something else does not look neat, he rushes to correct it. For example, number sequence written like \"1,2\u00a0,3,...,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a010\" will be corrected to \"1,\u00a02,\u00a03,\u00a0...,\u00a010\".\n\nIn this task you are given a string *s*, which is composed by a concatination of terms, each of which may be: \n -  a positive integer of an arbitrary length (leading zeroes are not allowed), -  a \"comma\" symbol (\",\"), -  a \"space\" symbol (\" \"), -  \"three dots\" (\"...\", that is, exactly three points written one after another, also known as suspension points). \nPolycarp wants to add and remove spaces in the string *s* to ensure the following: \n -  each comma is followed by exactly one space (if the comma is the last character in the string, this rule does not apply to it), -  each \"three dots\" term is preceded by exactly one space (if the dots are at the beginning of the string, this rule does not apply to the term), -  if two consecutive numbers were separated by spaces only (one or more), then exactly one of them should be left, -  there should not be other spaces. \nAutomate Polycarp's work and write a program that will process the given string *s*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input data contains a single string *s*.

An inversion in a permutation *p* is a pair of indices (*i*,<=*j*) such that *i*<=&gt;<=*j* and *a**i*<=&lt;<=*a**j*. For example, a permutation [4,<=1,<=3,<=2] contains 4 inversions: (2,<=1), (3,<=1), (4,<=1), (4,<=3).\n\nYou are given a permutation *a* of size *n* and *m* queries to it. Each query is represented by two indices *l* and *r* denoting that you have to reverse the segment [*l*,<=*r*] of the permutation. For example, if *a*<==<=[1,<=2,<=3,<=4] and a query *l*<==<=2, *r*<==<=4 is applied, then the resulting permutation is [1,<=4,<=3,<=2].\n\nAfter each query you have to determine whether the number of inversions is odd or even.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains one integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1500) \u2014 the size of the permutation. \n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of the permutation.

Fifa must put the access point inside the flat which has a circular shape of radius *R*. Fifa wants to minimize the area that is not covered by the access point inside the flat without letting Fafa or anyone outside the flat to get access to the internet.\n\nThe world is represented as an infinite 2D plane. The flat is centered at (*x*1,<=*y*1) and has radius *R* and Fafa's laptop is located at (*x*2,<=*y*2), not necessarily inside the flat. Find the position and the radius chosen by Fifa for his access point which minimizes the uncovered area.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe single line of the input contains 5 space-separated integers *R*,<=*x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2 (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=105, |*x*1|,<=|*y*1|,<=|*x*2|,<=|*y*2|<=\u2264<=105).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint three space-separated numbers *x**ap*,<=*y**ap*,<=*r* where (*x**ap*,<=*y**ap*) is the position which Fifa chose for the access point and *r* is the radius of its range. \n\nYour answer will be considered correct if the radius does not differ from optimal more than 10<=-<=6 absolutely or relatively, and also the radius you printed can be changed by no more than 10<=-<=6 (absolutely or relatively) in such a way that all points outside the flat and Fafa's laptop position are outside circle of the access point range.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 3 3 1 1\\n', '10 5 5 5 15\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3.7677669529663684 3.7677669529663684 3.914213562373095\\n', '5.0 5.0 10.0\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

We know that from any district there is a path along the roads to any other district. Let's enumerate all districts in some way by integers from 1 to *n*, inclusive. Furthermore, for each road the residents decided if it is the problem road or not. A problem road is a road that needs to be repaired.\n\nThere are *n* candidates running the elections. Let's enumerate all candidates in some way by integers from 1 to *n*, inclusive. If the candidate number *i* will be elected in the city Parliament, he will perform exactly one promise \u2014 to repair all problem roads on the way from the *i*-th district to the district 1, where the city Parliament is located.\n\nHelp Valera and determine the subset of candidates such that if all candidates from the subset will be elected to the city Parliament, all problem roads in the city will be repaired. If there are several such subsets, you should choose the subset consisting of the minimum number of candidates.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of districts in the city.\n\nThen *n*<=-<=1 lines follow.

If *t**i* equals to one, then the *i*-th road isn't the problem road; if *t**i* equals to two, then the *i*-th road is the problem road.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the graph structure of the city is a tree.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print a single non-negative number *k* \u2014 the minimum size of the required subset of candidates. Then on the second line print *k* space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=... *a**k* \u2014 the numbers of the candidates that form the required subset.

He have studied their properties and invented a new game.\n\nInitially, Bob chooses integer *m*, bit depth of the game, which means that all numbers in the game will consist of *m* bits. Then he asks Peter to choose some *m*-bit number. After that, Bob computes the values of *n* variables. Each variable is assigned either a constant *m*-bit number or result of bitwise operation. Operands of the operation may be either variables defined before, or the number, chosen by Peter. After that, Peter's score equals to the sum of all variable values.\n\nBob wants to know, what number Peter needs to choose to get the minimum possible score, and what number he needs to choose to get the maximum possible score. In both cases, if there are several ways to get the same score, find the minimum number, which he can choose.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *m*, the number of variables and bit depth, respectively (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5000; 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000). \n\nThe following *n* lines contain descriptions of the variables. Each line describes exactly one variable. Description has the following format: name of a new variable, space, sign \":=\", space, followed by one of:\n 1.  Binary number of exactly *m* bits. 1.  The first operand, space, bitwise operation (\"AND\", \"OR\" or \"XOR\"), space, the second operand. Each operand is either the name of variable defined before or symbol '?', indicating the number chosen by Peter. \nVariable names are strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length at most 10. All variable names are different.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line output the minimum number that should be chosen by Peter, to make the sum of all variable values minimum possible, in the second line output the minimum number that should be chosen by Peter, to make the sum of all variable values maximum possible. Both numbers should be printed as *m*-bit binary numbers.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 3\\na := 101\\nb := 011\\nc := ? XOR b\\n', '5 1\\na := 1\\nbb := 0\\ncx := ? OR a\\nd := ?

He received a playlist for tomorrow, that can be represented as a sequence *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, where *a**i* is a band, which performs the *i*-th song. Polycarp likes bands with the numbers from 1 to *m*, but he doesn't really like others. \n\nWe define as *b**j* the number of songs the group *j* is going to perform tomorrow. Polycarp wants to change the playlist in such a way that the minimum among the numbers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* will be as large as possible.\n\nFind this maximum possible value of the minimum among the *b**j* (1<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*m*), and the minimum number of changes in the playlist Polycarp needs to make to achieve it.

It is magic because in the end of each month the number of dresses in it doubles (i.e. the number of dresses becomes twice as large as it is in the beginning of the month).\n\nUnfortunately, right after the doubling the wardrobe eats one of the dresses (if any) with the 50% probability. It happens every month except the last one in the year. \n\nNastya owns *x* dresses now, so she became interested in the [expected number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) of dresses she will have in one year.

Boris's flat has *n* rooms, each of which has the form of a rectangular parallelepiped. For every room we known its length, width and height of the walls in meters (different rooms can have different dimensions, including height).\n\nBoris chose *m* types of wallpaper to paper the walls of the rooms with (but it is not necessary to use all the types). Each type of wallpaper is sold in rolls of a fixed length and width (the length, naturally, shows how long the unfolded roll will be). In addition, for each type we know the price of one roll of this type.\n\nThe wallpaper of each type contains strips running along the length of the roll. When gluing the strips must be located strictly vertically (so the roll cannot be rotated, even if the length is less than the width). Besides, a roll can be cut in an arbitrary manner, but the joints of glued pieces should also be vertical. In addition, each room should be papered by only one type of wallpaper. And pieces of the same roll cannot be used to paper different rooms. That is, for each room the rolls are purchased separately. Also, some rolls can be used not completely.\n\nAfter buying an apartment Boris is short of cash, so he wants to spend the minimum money on wallpaper. Help him.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=500) \u2014 the number of rooms in Boris's apartment.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains three space-separated positive integers \u2014 the length, width and height of the walls in a given room in meters, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains a positive integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=500) \u2014 the number of available wallpaper types.\n\nEach of the following *m* lines contains three space-separated positive integers \u2014 the length and width in meters of a given wallpaper and the price of one roll, respectively.\n\nAll numbers in the input data do not exceed 500.

Each cell of the maze is either empty or occupied by an obstacle. The Robot can move between neighboring cells on the side left (the symbol \"L\"), right (the symbol \"R\"), up (the symbol \"U\") or down (the symbol \"D\"). The Robot can move to the cell only if it is empty. Initially, the Robot is in the empty cell.\n\nYour task is to find lexicographically minimal Robot's cycle with length exactly *k*, which begins and ends in the cell where the Robot was initially. It is allowed to the Robot to visit any cell many times (including starting).\n\nConsider that Robot's way is given as a line which consists of symbols \"L\", \"R\", \"U\" and \"D\". For example, if firstly the Robot goes down, then left, then right and up, it means that his way is written as \"DLRU\".\n\nIn this task you don't need to minimize the length of the way. Find the minimum lexicographical (in alphabet order as in the dictionary) line which satisfies requirements above.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *m* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 the size of the maze and the length of the cycle. \n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains *m* symbols \u2014 the description of the maze. If the symbol equals to \".\" the current cell is empty. If the symbol equals to \"*\" the current cell is occupied by an obstacle. If the symbol equals to \"X\" then initially the Robot is in this cell and it is empty. It is guaranteed that the symbol \"X\" is found in the maze exactly once.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the lexicographically minimum Robot's way with the length exactly *k*, which starts and ends in the cell where initially Robot is.

The second cycle is lexicographically less. \n\nIn the second sample the Robot should move in the following way: down, left, down, down, left, left, left, right, right, right, up, up, right, up. \n\nIn the third sample the Robot can't move to the neighboring cells, because they are occupied by obstacles.",

        "prompt": "Title: Balls and Boxes\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nLittle Vasya had *n* boxes with balls in the room. The boxes stood in a row and were numbered with numbers from 1 to *n* from left to right.\n\nOnce Vasya chose one of the boxes, let's assume that its number is *i*, took all balls out from it (it is guaranteed that this box originally had at least one ball), and began putting balls (one at a time) to the boxes with numbers *i*<=+<=1, *i*<=+<=2, *i*<=+<=3 and so on. If Vasya puts a ball into the box number *n*, then the next ball goes to box 1, the next one goes to box 2 and so on. He did it until he had no balls left in his hands. It is possible that Vasya puts multiple balls to the same box, and it is also possible that one or more balls will go to the box number *i*. If *i*<==<=*n*, Vasya puts the first ball into the box number 1, then the next ball goes to box 2 and so on. \n\nFor example, let's suppose that initially Vasya had four boxes, and the first box had 3 balls, the second one had 2, the third one had 5 and the fourth one had 4 balls. Then, if *i*<==<=3, then Vasya will take all five balls out of the third box and put them in the boxes with numbers: 4,<=1,<=2,<=3,<=4. After all Vasya's actions the balls will lie in the boxes as follows: in the first box there are 4 balls, 3 in the second one, 1 in the third one and 6 in the fourth one.\n\nAt this point Vasya has completely forgotten the original arrangement of the balls in the boxes, but he knows how they are arranged now, and the number *x* \u2014 the number of the box, where he put the last of the taken out balls.\n\nHe asks you to help to find the initial arrangement of the balls in the boxes.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *x* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*), that represent the number of the boxes and the index of the box that got the last ball from Vasya, correspondingly. The second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, where integer *a**i* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109, *a**x*<=\u2260<=0) represents the number of balls in the box with index *i* after Vasya completes all the actions. \n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *n* integers, where the *i*-th one represents the number of balls in the box number *i* before Vasya starts acting. Separate the numbers in the output by spaces.

But it turns out to be pretty hard for her, because she is too young. Therefore, her brother Sergey always helps her.\n\nSergey gives Nastya the word *t* and wants to get the word *p* out of it. Nastya removes letters in a certain order (one after another, in this order strictly), which is specified by permutation of letters' indices of the word *t*: *a*1... *a*|*t*|. We denote the length of word *x* as |*x*|. Note that after removing one letter, the indices of other letters don't change. For example, if *t*<==<=\"nastya\" and *a*<==<=[4,<=1,<=5,<=3,<=2,<=6] then removals make the following sequence of words \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\".\n\nSergey knows this permutation. His goal is to stop his sister at some point and continue removing by himself to get the word *p*. Since Nastya likes this activity, Sergey wants to stop her as late as possible. Your task is to determine, how many letters Nastya can remove before she will be stopped by Sergey.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the word *p* can be obtained by removing the letters from word *t*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first and second lines of the input contain the words *t* and *p*, respectively. Words are composed of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet (1<=\u2264<=|*p*|<=&lt;<=|*t*|<=\u2264<=200<=000). It is guaranteed that the word *p* can be obtained by removing the letters from word *t*.\n\nNext line contains a permutation *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a*|*t*| of letter indices that specifies the order in which Nastya removes letters of *t* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=|*t*|, all *a**i* are distinct).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer number, the maximum number of letters that Nastya can remove.\n\nDemo Input:\n['ababcba\\nabb\\n5 3 4 1 7 6 2\\n', 'bbbabb\\nbb\\n1 6 3 4 2 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3', '4']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample test sequence of removing made by Nastya looks like this:\n\n\"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" \n\nNastya can not continue, because it is impossible to get word \"abb\" from word \"ababcba\".\n\nSo, Nastya will remove only three letters.",

So he was asked to make a very important experiment: to melt the chocolate bar with a new laser device. The device consists of a rectangular field of *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* cells and a robotic arm. Each cell of the field is a 1<=\u00d7<=1 square. The robotic arm has two lasers pointed at the field perpendicularly to its surface. At any one time lasers are pointed at the centres of some two cells. Since the lasers are on the robotic hand, their movements are synchronized \u2014 if you move one of the lasers by a vector, another one moves by the same vector.\n\nThe following facts about the experiment are known: \n -  initially the whole field is covered with a chocolate bar of the size *n*<=\u00d7<=*m*, both lasers are located above the field and are active; -  the chocolate melts within one cell of the field at which the laser is pointed; -  all moves of the robotic arm should be parallel to the sides of the field, after each move the lasers should be pointed at the centres of some two cells; -  at any one time both lasers should be pointed at the field. Petya doesn't want to become a second Gordon Freeman. \nYou are given *n*, *m* and the cells (*x*1,<=*y*1) and (*x*2,<=*y*2), where the lasers are initially pointed at (*x**i* is a column number, *y**i* is a row number).

        "prompt": "Title: Doctor\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThere are *n* animals in the queue to Dr. Dolittle. When an animal comes into the office, the doctor examines him, gives prescriptions, appoints tests and may appoint extra examination. Doc knows all the forest animals perfectly well and therefore knows exactly that the animal number *i* in the queue will have to visit his office exactly *a**i* times. We will assume that an examination takes much more time than making tests and other extra procedures, and therefore we will assume that once an animal leaves the room, it immediately gets to the end of the queue to the doctor. Of course, if the animal has visited the doctor as many times as necessary, then it doesn't have to stand at the end of the queue and it immediately goes home. \n\nDoctor plans to go home after receiving *k* animals, and therefore what the queue will look like at that moment is important for him. Since the doctor works long hours and she can't get distracted like that after all, she asked you to figure it out.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input data contains two space-separated integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=1014). In the second line are given space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109).\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit numbers in C++. It is recommended to use cin, cout streams (you can also use the %I64d specificator).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf the doctor will overall carry out less than *k* examinations, print a single number \"-1\" (without quotes). Otherwise, print the sequence of numbers \u2014 number of animals in the order in which they stand in the queue. \n\nNote that this sequence may be empty. This case is present in pretests. You can just print nothing or print one \"End of line\"-character. Both will be accepted.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 3\\n1 2 1\\n', '4 10\\n3 3 2 1\\n', '7 10\\n1 3 3 1 2 3 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2 ', '-1\\n', '6 2 3 ']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample test:\n -  Before examination: {1,\u20092,\u20093} -  After the first examination: {2,\u20093} -  After the second examination: {3,\u20092} -  After the third examination: {2} \nIn the second sample test:\n -  Before examination: {1,\u20092,\u20093,\u20094,\u20095,\u20096,\u20097} -  After the first examination: {2,\u20093,\u20094,\u20095,\u20096,\u20097} -  After the second examination: {3,\u20094,\u20095,\u20096,\u20097,\u20092} -  After the third examination: {4,\u20095,\u20096,\u20097,\u20092,\u20093} -  After the fourth examination: {5,\u20096,\u20097,\u20092,\u20093} -  After the fifth examination: {6,\u20097,\u20092,\u20093,\u20095} -  After the sixth examination: {7,\u20092,\u20093,\u20095,\u20096} -  After the seventh examination: {2,\u20093,\u20095,\u20096} -  After the eighth examination: {3,\u20095,\u20096,\u20092} -  After the ninth examination: {5,\u20096,\u20092,\u20093} -  After the tenth examination: {6,\u20092,\u20093}",

They are going to compete in a race with a distance of *L* meters today.\n\nWillman and Bolt have exactly the same speed, so when they compete the result is always a tie. That is a problem for the organizers because they want a winner. \n\nWhile watching previous races the organizers have noticed that Willman can perform only steps of length equal to *w* meters, and Bolt can perform only steps of length equal to *b* meters. Organizers decided to slightly change the rules of the race. Now, at the end of the racetrack there will be an abyss, and the winner will be declared the athlete, who manages to run farther from the starting point of the the racetrack (which is not the subject to change by any of the athletes). \n\nNote that none of the athletes can run infinitely far, as they both will at some moment of time face the point, such that only one step further will cause them to fall in the abyss. In other words, the athlete will not fall into the abyss if the total length of all his steps will be less or equal to the chosen distance *L*.\n\nSince the organizers are very fair, the are going to set the length of the racetrack as an integer chosen randomly and uniformly in range from 1 to *t* (both are included). What is the probability that Willman and Bolt tie again today?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains three integers *t*, *w* and *b* (1<=\u2264<=*t*,<=*w*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=5\u00b71018) \u2014 the maximum possible length of the racetrack, the length of Willman's steps and the length of Bolt's steps respectively.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the answer to the problem as an irreducible fraction . Follow the format of the samples output.\n\nThe fraction  (*p* and *q* are integers, and both *p*<=\u2265<=0 and *q*<=&gt;<=0 holds) is called irreducible, if there is no such integer *d*<=&gt;<=1, that both *p* and *q* are divisible by *d*.\n\nDemo Input:\n['10 3 2\\n', '7 1 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3/10\\n', '3/7\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample Willman and Bolt will tie in case 1, 6 or 7 are chosen as the length of the racetrack.",

        "prompt": "Title: Processing Queries\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIn this problem you have to simulate the workflow of one-thread server. There are *n* queries to process, the *i*-th will be received at moment *t**i* and needs to be processed for *d**i* units of time. All *t**i* are guaranteed to be distinct.\n\nWhen a query appears server may react in three possible ways: \n 1.  If server is free and query queue is empty, then server immediately starts to process this query. 1.  If server is busy and there are less than *b* queries in the queue, then new query is added to the end of the queue. 1.  If server is busy and there are already *b* queries pending in the queue, then new query is just rejected and will never be processed. \nAs soon as server finished to process some query, it picks new one from the queue (if it's not empty, of course). If a new query comes at some moment *x*, and the server finishes to process another query at exactly the same moment, we consider that first query is picked from the queue and only then new query appears.\n\nFor each query find the moment when the server will finish to process it or print -1 if this query will be rejected.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *b* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=200<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries and the maximum possible size of the query queue.\n\nThen follow *n* lines with queries descriptions (in chronological order). Each description consists of two integers *t**i* and *d**i* (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*,<=*d**i*<=\u2264<=109), where *t**i* is the moment of time when the *i*-th query appears and *d**i* is the time server needs to process it. It is guaranteed that *t**i*<=-<=1<=&lt;<=*t**i* for all *i*<=&gt;<=1.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the sequence of *n* integers *e*1,<=*e*2,<=...,<=*e**n*, where *e**i* is the moment the server will finish to process the *i*-th query (queries are numbered in the order they appear in the input) or <=-<=1 if the corresponding query will be rejected.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 1\\n2 9\\n4 8\\n10 9\\n15 2\\n19 1\\n', '4 1\\n2 8\\n4 8\\n10 9\\n15 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['11 19 -1 21 22 \\n', '10 18 27 -1 \\n']\n\nNote:\nConsider the first sample. \n 1.  The server will start to process first query at the moment 2 and will finish to process it at the moment 11. 1.  At the moment 4 second query appears and proceeds to the queue. 1.

Therefore the coach of team \"Losewille Rangers\" decided to resume the practice, that were indefinitely interrupted for uncertain reasons. Overall there are *n* players in \"Losewille Rangers\". Each player on the team has a number \u2014 a unique integer from 1 to *n*. To prepare for the championship, the coach Mr. Floppe decided to spend some number of practices.\n\nMr. Floppe spent some long nights of his holiday planning how to conduct the practices. He came to a very complex practice system. Each practice consists of one game, all *n* players of the team take part in the game. The players are sorted into two teams in some way. In this case, the teams may have different numbers of players, but each team must have at least one player.\n\nThe coach wants to be sure that after the series of the practice sessions each pair of players had at least one practice, when they played in different teams. As the players' energy is limited, the coach wants to achieve the goal in the least number of practices.\n\nHelp him to schedule the practices.\n\nInput Specification:\nA single input line contains integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print *m* \u2014 the minimum number of practices the coach will have to schedule.

Bending sticks is not allowed.\n\nSticks with lengths *a*1, *a*2, *a*3 and *a*4 can make a rectangle if the following properties are observed:\n -  *a*1<=\u2264<=*a*2<=\u2264<=*a*3<=\u2264<=*a*4 -  *a*1<==<=*a*2 -  *a*3<==<=*a*4 \nA rectangle can be made of sticks with lengths of, for example, 3\u00a03\u00a03\u00a03 or 2\u00a02\u00a04\u00a04. A rectangle cannot be made of, for example, sticks 5\u00a05\u00a05\u00a07.\n\nIlya also has an instrument which can reduce the length of the sticks. The sticks are made of a special material, so the length of each stick can be reduced by at most one. For example, a stick with length 5 can either stay at this length or be transformed into a stick of length 4.\n\nYou have to answer the question \u2014 what maximum total area of the rectangles can Ilya get with a file if makes rectangles from the available sticks?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the number of the available sticks.\n\nThe second line of the input contains *n* positive integers *l**i* (2<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=106)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the lengths of the sticks.\n\nOutput Specification:\nThe first line of the output must contain a single non-negative integer\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the maximum total area of the rectangles that Ilya can make from the available sticks.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n2 4 4 2\\n', '4\\n2 2 3 5\\n', '4\\n100003 100004 100005 100006\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['8\\n', '0\\n', '10000800015\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Planets\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nGoa'uld Apophis captured Jack O'Neill's team again! Jack himself was able to escape, but by that time Apophis's ship had already jumped to hyperspace. But Jack knows on what planet will Apophis land. In order to save his friends, Jack must repeatedly go through stargates to get to this planet.\n\nOverall the galaxy has *n* planets, indexed with numbers from 1 to *n*. Jack is on the planet with index 1, and Apophis will land on the planet with index *n*. Jack can move between some pairs of planets through stargates (he can move in both directions); the transfer takes a positive, and, perhaps, for different pairs of planets unequal number of seconds. Jack begins his journey at time 0.\n\nIt can be that other travellers are arriving to the planet where Jack is currently located. In this case, Jack has to wait for exactly 1 second before he can use the stargate. That is, if at time *t* another traveller arrives to the planet, Jack can only pass through the stargate at time *t*<=+<=1, unless there are more travellers arriving at time *t*<=+<=1 to the same planet.\n\nKnowing the information about travel times between the planets, and the times when Jack would not be able to use the stargate on particular planets, determine the minimum time in which he can get to the planet with index *n*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers: *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105), the number of planets in the galaxy, and *m* (0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of pairs of planets between which Jack can travel using stargates. Then *m* lines follow, containing three integers each: the *i*-th line contains numbers of planets *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *a**i*<=\u2260<=*b**i*), which are connected through stargates, and the integer transfer time (in seconds) *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=104) between these planets. It is guaranteed that between any pair of planets there is at most one stargate connection.\n\nThen *n* lines follow: the *i*-th line contains an integer *k**i* (0<=\u2264<=*k**i*<=\u2264<=105) that denotes the number of moments of time when other travellers arrive to the planet with index *i*. Then *k**i* distinct space-separated integers *t**ij* (0<=\u2264<=*t**ij*<=&lt;<=109) follow, sorted in ascending order. An integer *t**ij* means that at time *t**ij* (in seconds) another traveller arrives to the planet *i*. It is guaranteed that the sum of all *k**i* does not exceed 105.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number \u2014 the least amount of time Jack needs to get from planet 1 to planet *n*. If Jack can't get to planet *n* in any amount of time, print number -1.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 6\\n1 2 2\\n1 3 3\\n1 4 8\\n2 3 4\\n2 4 5\\n3 4 3\\n0\\n1 3\\n2 3 4\\n0\\n', '3 1\\n1 2 3\\n0\\n1 3\\n0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['7\\n', '-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample Jack has three ways to go from planet 1. If he moves to planet 4 at once, he spends 8 seconds. If he transfers to planet 3, he spends 3 seconds, but as other travellers arrive to planet 3 at time 3 and 4, he can travel to planet 4 only at time 5, thus spending 8 seconds in total. But if Jack moves to planet 2, and then \u2014 to planet 4, then he spends a total of only 2\u2009+\u20095\u2009=\u20097 seconds.\n\nIn the second sample one can't get from planet 1 to planet 3 by moving through stargates.",

        "prompt": "Title: Hometask\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nSergey attends lessons of the *N*-ish language. Each lesson he receives a hometask. This time the task is to translate some sentence to the *N*-ish language. Sentences of the *N*-ish language can be represented as strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters without spaces or punctuation marks.\n\nSergey totally forgot about the task until half an hour before the next lesson and hastily scribbled something down. But then he recollected that in the last lesson he learned the grammar of *N*-ish. The spelling rules state that *N*-ish contains some \"forbidden\" pairs of letters: such letters can never occur in a sentence next to each other. Also, the order of the letters doesn't matter (for example, if the pair of letters \"ab\" is forbidden, then any occurrences of substrings \"ab\" and \"ba\" are also forbidden). Also, each pair has different letters and each letter occurs in no more than one forbidden pair.\n\nNow Sergey wants to correct his sentence so that it doesn't contain any \"forbidden\" pairs of letters that stand next to each other. However, he is running out of time, so he decided to simply cross out some letters from the sentence. What smallest number of letters will he have to cross out? When a letter is crossed out, it is \"removed\" so that the letters to its left and right (if they existed), become neighboring. For example, if we cross out the first letter from the string \"aba\", we get the string \"ba\", and if we cross out the second letter, we get \"aa\".\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a non-empty string *s*, consisting of lowercase Latin letters \u2014 that's the initial sentence in *N*-ish, written by Sergey. The length of string *s* doesn't exceed 105.\n\nThe next line contains integer *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=13) \u2014 the number of forbidden pairs of letters.\n\nNext *k* lines contain descriptions of forbidden pairs of letters. Each line contains exactly two different lowercase Latin letters without separators that represent the forbidden pairs. It is guaranteed that each letter is included in no more than one pair.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the single number \u2014 the smallest number of letters that need to be removed to get a string without any forbidden pairs of neighboring letters. Please note that the answer always exists as it is always possible to remove all letters.\n\nDemo Input:\n['ababa\\n1\\nab\\n', 'codeforces\\n2\\ndo\\ncs\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '1\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample you should remove two letters b.\n\nIn the second sample you should remove the second or the third letter.

This problem deals with a simplified version of the game.\n\nOverall, the game has 25 types of cards (5 distinct colors and 5 distinct values). Borya is holding *n* cards. The game is somewhat complicated by the fact that everybody sees Borya's cards except for Borya himself. Borya knows which cards he has but he knows nothing about the order they lie in. Note that Borya can have multiple identical cards (and for each of the 25 types of cards he knows exactly how many cards of this type he has).\n\nThe aim of the other players is to achieve the state when Borya knows the color and number value of each of his cards. For that, other players can give him hints. The hints can be of two types: color hints and value hints. \n\nA color hint goes like that: a player names some color and points at all the cards of this color. \n\nSimilarly goes the value hint. A player names some value and points at all the cards that contain the value.\n\nDetermine what minimum number of hints the other players should make for Borya to be certain about each card's color and value.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of Borya's cards. The next line contains the descriptions of *n* cards. The description of each card consists of exactly two characters. The first character shows the color (overall this position can contain five distinct letters \u2014 R, G, B, Y, W). The second character shows the card's value (a digit from 1 to 5). Borya doesn't know exact order of the cards they lie in.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of hints that the other players should make.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2\\nG3 G3\\n', '4\\nG4 R4 R3 B3\\n', '5\\nB1 Y1 W1 G1 R1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0\\n', '2\\n', '4\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample Borya already knows for each card that it is a green three.\n\nIn the second sample we can show all fours and all red cards.\n\nIn the third sample you need to make hints about any four colors.",

It's time for Iahub and Iahubina to work out, as they both want to look hot at the beach. The gym where they go is a matrix *a* with *n* lines and *m* columns. Let number *a*[*i*][*j*] represents the calories burned by performing workout at the cell of gym in the *i*-th line and the *j*-th column.\n\nIahub starts with workout located at line 1 and column 1. He needs to finish with workout *a*[*n*][*m*]. After finishing workout *a*[*i*][*j*], he can go to workout *a*[*i*<=+<=1][*j*] or *a*[*i*][*j*<=+<=1]. Similarly, Iahubina starts with workout *a*[*n*][1] and she needs to finish with workout *a*[1][*m*]. After finishing workout from cell *a*[*i*][*j*], she goes to either *a*[*i*][*j*<=+<=1] or *a*[*i*<=-<=1][*j*]. \n\nThere is one additional condition for their training. They have to meet in exactly one cell of gym. At that cell, none of them will work out. They will talk about fast exponentiation (pretty odd small talk) and then both of them will move to the next workout.\n\nIf a workout was done by either Iahub or Iahubina, it counts as total gain. Please plan a workout for Iahub and Iahubina such as total gain to be as big as possible. Note, that Iahub and Iahubina can perform workouts with different speed, so the number of cells that they use to reach meet cell may differs.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* (3<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000).

City 0 is Metropolis that is the meeting point for all jury members. For each city from 1 to *n* there is exactly one jury member living there. Olympiad preparation is a long and demanding process that requires *k* days of work. For all of these *k* days each of the *n* jury members should be present in Metropolis to be able to work on problems.\n\nYou know the flight schedule in the country (jury members consider themselves important enough to only use flights for transportation). All flights in Metropolia are either going to Metropolis or out of Metropolis. There are no night flights in Metropolia, or in the other words, plane always takes off at the same day it arrives. On his arrival day and departure day jury member is not able to discuss the olympiad. All flights in Megapolia depart and arrive at the same day.\n\nGather everybody for *k* days in the capital is a hard objective, doing that while spending the minimum possible money is even harder. Nevertheless, your task is to arrange the cheapest way to bring all of the jury members to Metrpolis, so that they can work together for *k* days and then send them back to their home cities.

He was very proud of his men and he liked to invite the King to come and watch drill exercises which demonstrated the fighting techniques and tactics of the squad he was in charge of. But time went by and one day Sir Lancelot had a major argument with the Fairy Godmother (there were rumors that the argument occurred after the general spoke badly of the Godmother's flying techniques. That seemed to hurt the Fairy Godmother very deeply). \n\nAs the result of the argument, the Godmother put a rather strange curse upon the general. It sounded all complicated and quite harmless: \"If the squared distance between some two soldiers equals to 5, then those soldiers will conflict with each other!\"\n\nThe drill exercises are held on a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field, split into *nm* square 1<=\u00d7<=1 segments for each soldier. Thus, the square of the distance between the soldiers that stand on squares (*x*1,<=*y*1) and (*x*2,<=*y*2) equals exactly (*x*1<=-<=*x*2)2<=+<=(*y*1<=-<=*y*2)2. Now not all *nm* squad soldiers can participate in the drill exercises as it was before the Fairy Godmother's curse. Unless, of course, the general wants the soldiers to fight with each other or even worse... For example, if he puts a soldier in the square (2,<=2), then he cannot put soldiers in the squares (1,<=4), (3,<=4), (4,<=1) and (4,<=3) \u2014 each of them will conflict with the soldier in the square (2,<=2).\n\nYour task is to help the general.

You decided to implement an analog sorting algorithm yourself, but as you survey your pantry you realize you're out of spaghetti! The only type of pasta you have is ravioli, but you are not going to let this stop you...\n\nYou come up with the following algorithm. For each number in the array *a**i*, build a stack of *a**i* ravioli. The image shows the stack for *a**i*<==<=4.\n\nArrange the stacks in one row in the order in which the corresponding numbers appear in the input array. Find the tallest one (if there are several stacks of maximal height, use the leftmost one). Remove it and add its height to the end of the output array. Shift the stacks in the row so that there is no gap between them. Repeat the procedure until all stacks have been removed.\n\nAt first you are very happy with your algorithm, but as you try it on more inputs you realize that it doesn't always produce the right sorted array. Turns out when two stacks of ravioli are next to each other (at any step of the process) and differ in height by two or more, the top ravioli of the taller stack slides down on top of the lower stack.\n\nGiven an input array, figure out whether the described algorithm will sort it correctly.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains a single number *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=10) \u2014 the size of the array.\n\nThe second line of input contains *n* space-separated integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the elements of the array.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput \"YES\" if the array can be sorted using the described procedure and \"NO\" if it can not.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n1 2 3\\n', '3\\n3 1 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the second example the array will change even before the tallest stack is chosen for the first time: ravioli from stack of height 3 will slide on the stack of height 1, and the algorithm will output an array {2,\u20092,\u20092}.",

For every ,  *A**i*,<=*j*<==<=*y*(*i*<=-<=1)<=+<=*j*. Obviously, every integer from [1..*xy*] occurs exactly once in this matrix. \n\nYou have traversed some path in this matrix. Your path can be described as a sequence of visited cells *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* denoting that you started in the cell containing the number *a*1, then moved to the cell with the number *a*2, and so on.\n\nFrom the cell located in *i*-th line and *j*-th column (we denote this cell as (*i*,<=*j*)) you can move into one of the following cells:\n1.  (*i*<=+<=1,<=*j*) \u2014 only if *i*<=&lt;<=*x*; 1.  (*i*,<=*j*<=+<=1) \u2014 only if *j*<=&lt;<=*y*; 1.  (*i*<=-<=1,<=*j*) \u2014 only if *i*<=&gt;<=1; 1.  (*i*,<=*j*<=-<=1) \u2014 only if *j*<=&gt;<=1.\nNotice that making a move requires you to go to an adjacent cell. It is not allowed to stay in the same cell. You don't know *x* and *y* exactly, but you have to find any possible values for these numbers such that you could start in the cell containing the integer *a*1, then move to the cell containing *a*2 (in one step), then move to the cell containing *a*3 (also in one step) and so on. Can you choose *x* and *y* so that they don't contradict with your sequence of moves?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains one integer number *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the number of cells you visited on your path (if some cell is visited twice, then it's listed twice).\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the integers in the cells on your path.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf all possible values of *x* and *y* such that 1<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=\u2264<=109 contradict with the information about your path, print NO.\n\nOtherwise, print YES in the first line, and in the second line print the values *x* and *y* such that your path was possible with such number of lines and columns in the matrix.

Here sit the senators who take the most important decisions for the player. For example, to expand the range of the shop or to improve certain characteristics of the character the Dark Assembly's approval is needed.\n\nThe Dark Assembly consists of *n* senators. Each of them is characterized by his level and loyalty to the player. The level is a positive integer which reflects a senator's strength. Loyalty is the probability of a positive decision in the voting, which is measured as a percentage with precision of up to 10%. \n\nSenators make decisions by voting. Each of them makes a positive or negative decision in accordance with their loyalty. If strictly more than half of the senators take a positive decision, the player's proposal is approved. \n\nIf the player's proposal is not approved after the voting, then the player may appeal against the decision of the Dark Assembly. To do that, player needs to kill all the senators that voted against (there's nothing wrong in killing senators, they will resurrect later and will treat the player even worse). The probability that a player will be able to kill a certain group of senators is equal to *A*<=/<=(*A*<=+<=*B*), where *A* is the sum of levels of all player's characters and *B* is the sum of levels of all senators in this group. If the player kills all undesired senators, then his proposal is approved.\n\nSenators are very fond of sweets. They can be bribed by giving them candies. For each received candy a senator increases his loyalty to the player by 10%. It's worth to mention that loyalty cannot exceed 100%. The player can take no more than *k* sweets to the courtroom. Candies should be given to the senators before the start of voting.\n\nDetermine the probability that the Dark Assembly approves the player's proposal if the candies are distributed among the senators in the optimal way.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *k* and *A* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=8, 1<=\u2264<=*A*<=\u2264<=9999).\n\nThen *n* lines follow. The *i*-th of them contains two numbers \u2014 *b**i* and *l**i* \u2014 the *i*-th senator's level and his loyalty.\n\nThe levels of all senators are integers in range from 1 to 9999 (inclusive). The loyalties of all senators are integers in range from 0 to 100 (inclusive) and all of them are divisible by 10.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint one real number with precision 10<=-<=6 \u2014 the maximal possible probability that the Dark Assembly approves the player's proposal for the best possible distribution of candies among the senators.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 6 100\\n11 80\\n14 90\\n23 70\\n80 30\\n153 70\\n', '5 3 100\\n11 80\\n14 90\\n23 70\\n80 30\\n153 70\\n', '1 3 20\\n20 20\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1.0000000000\\n', '0.9628442962\\n', '0.7500000000\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample the best way of candies' distribution is giving them to first three of the senators.

        "prompt": "Title: Treasure Hunt\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nAfter the big birthday party, Katie still wanted Shiro to have some more fun. Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\"). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print \"Draw\".\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\nKuroo\\nShiro\\nKatie\\n', '7\\ntreasurehunt\\nthreefriends\\nhiCodeforces\\n', '1\\nabcabc\\ncbabac\\nababca\\n', '15\\nfoPaErcvJ\\nmZaxowpbt\\nmkuOlaHRE\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['Kuro\\n', 'Shiro\\n', 'Katie\\n', 'Draw\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice. Therefore, the game ends in a draw.",

        "prompt": "Title: Champions' League\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIn the autumn of this year, two Russian teams came into the group stage of the most prestigious football club competition in the world \u2014 the UEFA Champions League. Now, these teams have already started to play in the group stage and are fighting for advancing to the playoffs. In this problem we are interested in the draw stage, the process of sorting teams into groups.\n\nThe process of the draw goes as follows (the rules that are described in this problem, are somehow simplified compared to the real life). Suppose *n* teams will take part in the group stage (*n* is divisible by four). The teams should be divided into groups of four. Let's denote the number of groups as *m* (). Each team has a rating \u2014 an integer characterizing the team's previous achievements. The teams are sorted by the rating's decreasing (no two teams have the same rating).\n\nAfter that four \"baskets\" are formed, each of which will contain *m* teams: the first *m* teams with the highest rating go to the first basket, the following *m* teams go to the second one, and so on.\n\nThen the following procedure repeats *m*<=-<=1 times. A team is randomly taken from each basket, first from the first basket, then from the second, then from the third, and at last, from the fourth. The taken teams form another group. After that, they are removed from their baskets.\n\nThe four teams remaining in the baskets after (*m*<=-<=1) such procedures are performed, form the last group.\n\nIn the real draw the random selection of teams from the basket is performed by people \u2014 as a rule, the well-known players of the past. As we have none, we will use a random number generator, which is constructed as follows. Its parameters are four positive integers *x*,<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*. Every time there is a call to the random number generator, it produces the following actions:\n -  calculates ; -  replaces parameter *x* by value *y* (assigns ); -  returns *x* as another random number. \nOperation  means taking the remainder after division: , .\n\nA random number generator will be used in the draw as follows: each time we need to randomly choose a team from the basket, it will generate a random number *k*. The teams that yet remain in the basket are considered numbered with consecutive integers from 0 to *s*<=-<=1, in the order of decreasing rating, where *s* is the current size of the basket. Then a team number  is taken from the basket.\n\nGiven a list of teams and the parameters of the random number generator, determine the result of the draw.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains integer *n* (4<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=64, *n* is divisible by four) \u2014 the number of teams that take part in the sorting. The second line contains four space-separated integers *x*,<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*c* (1<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the parameters of the random number generator. Each of the following *n* lines describes one team. The description consists of the name of the team and its rating, separated by a single space. The name of a team consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and has length from 1 to 20 characters. A team's rating is an integer from 0 to 1000. All teams' names are distinct. All team's ratings are also distinct.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the way the teams must be sorted into groups. Print the groups in the order, in which they are formed in the sorting. Number the groups by consecutive uppercase English letters, starting from letter 'A'. Inside each group print the teams' names one per line, in the order of decreasing of the teams' rating.

        "prompt": "Title: Literature Lesson\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nVera adores poems. All the poems Vera knows are divided into quatrains (groups of four lines) and in each quatrain some lines contain rhymes.\n\nLet's consider that all lines in the poems consist of lowercase Latin letters (without spaces). Letters \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\" are considered vowels.\n\nTwo lines rhyme if their suffixes that start from the *k*-th vowels (counting from the end) match. If a line has less than *k* vowels, then such line can't rhyme with any other line. For example, if *k*<==<=1, lines *commit* and *hermit* rhyme (the corresponding suffixes equal *it*), and if *k*<==<=2, they do not rhyme (*ommit*<=\u2260<=*ermit*).\n\nToday on a literature lesson Vera learned that quatrains can contain four different schemes of rhymes, namely the following ones (the same letters stand for rhyming lines): \n -  Clerihew (*aabb*); -  Alternating (*abab*); -  Enclosed (*abba*). \nIf all lines of a quatrain pairwise rhyme, then the quatrain can belong to any rhyme scheme (this situation is represented by *aaaa*).\n\nIf all quatrains of a poem belong to the same rhyme scheme, then we can assume that the whole poem belongs to this rhyme scheme. If in each quatrain all lines pairwise rhyme, then the rhyme scheme of the poem is *aaaa*. Let us note that it doesn't matter whether lines from different quatrains rhyme with each other or not. In other words, it is possible that different quatrains aren't connected by a rhyme.\n\nVera got a long poem as a home task. The girl has to analyse it and find the poem rhyme scheme. Help Vera cope with the task.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2500, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of quatrains in the poem and the vowel's number, correspondingly. Next 4*n* lines contain the poem. Each line is not empty and only consists of small Latin letters. The total length of the lines does not exceed 104.\n\nIf we assume that the lines are numbered starting from 1, then the first quatrain contains lines number 1, 2, 3, 4; the second one contains lines number 5, 6, 7, 8; and so on.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the rhyme scheme of the poem as \"aabb\", \"abab\", \"abba\", \"aaaa\"; or \"NO\" if the poem does not belong to any of the above mentioned schemes.\n\nDemo Input:\n['1 1\\nday\\nmay\\nsun\\nfun\\n', '1 1\\nday\\nmay\\ngray\\nway\\n', '2 1\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\na\\ne\\ne\\n', '2 1\\nday\\nmay\\nsun\\nfun\\ntest\\nhill\\nfest\\nthrill\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['aabb\\n', 'aaaa\\n', 'aabb\\n', 'NO\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the last sample both quatrains have rhymes but finding the common scheme is impossible, so the answer is \"NO\".",

She knows that the Martians are very poor aliens. To ensure a better life for the Mars citizens, their emperor decided to take tax from every tourist who visited the planet. Natasha is the inhabitant of Earth, therefore she had to pay the tax to enter the territory of Mars.\n\nThere are $n$ banknote denominations on Mars: the value of $i$-th banknote is $a_i$. Natasha has an infinite number of banknotes of each denomination.\n\nMartians have $k$ fingers on their hands, so they use a number system with base $k$. In addition, the Martians consider the digit $d$ (in the number system with base $k$) divine. Thus, if the last digit in Natasha's tax amount written in the number system with the base $k$ is $d$, the Martians will be happy. Unfortunately, Natasha does not know the Martians' divine digit yet.\n\nDetermine for which values $d$ Natasha can make the Martians happy.\n\nNatasha can use only her banknotes. Martians don't give her change.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000$, $2 \\le k \\le 100\\,000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of denominations of banknotes and the base of the number system on Mars.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 denominations of banknotes on Mars.\n\nAll numbers are given in decimal notation.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOn the first line output the number of values $d$ for which Natasha can make the Martians happy.\n\nIn the second line, output all these values in increasing order.\n\nPrint all numbers in decimal notation.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 8\\n12 20\\n', '3 10\\n10 20 30\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n0 4 ', '1\\n0 ']\n\nNote:\nConsider the first test case. It uses the octal number system.\n\nIf you take one banknote with the value of $12$, you will get $14_8$ in octal system. The last digit is $4_8$.\n\nIf you take one banknote with the value of $12$ and one banknote with the value of $20$, the total value will be $32$. In the octal system, it is $40_8$. The last digit is $0_8$.\n\nIf you take two banknotes with the value of $20$, the total value will be $40$, this is $50_8$ in the octal system. The last digit is $0_8$.\n\nNo other digits other than $0_8$ and $4_8$ can be obtained. Digits $0_8$ and $4_8$ could also be obtained in other ways.\n\nThe second test case uses the decimal number system.

        "prompt": "Title: Correct Bracket Sequence Editor\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nRecently Polycarp started to develop a text editor that works only with correct bracket sequences (abbreviated as CBS). \n\nNote that a bracket sequence is correct if it is possible to get a correct mathematical expression by adding \"+\"-s and \"1\"-s to it. For example, sequences \"(())()\", \"()\" and \"(()(()))\" are correct, while \")(\", \"(()\" and \"(()))(\" are not. Each bracket in CBS has a pair. For example, in \"(()(()))\":\n -  1st bracket is paired with 8th, -  2d bracket is paired with 3d, -  3d bracket is paired with 2d, -  4th bracket is paired with 7th, -  5th bracket is paired with 6th, -  6th bracket is paired with 5th, -  7th bracket is paired with 4th, -  8th bracket is paired with 1st. \nPolycarp's editor currently supports only three operations during the use of CBS. The cursor in the editor takes the whole position of one of the brackets (not the position between the brackets!). There are three operations being supported:\n -  \u00abL\u00bb\u00a0\u2014 move the cursor one position to the left, -  \u00abR\u00bb\u00a0\u2014 move the cursor one position to the right, -  \u00abD\u00bb\u00a0\u2014 delete the bracket in which the cursor is located, delete the bracket it's paired to and all brackets between them (that is, delete a substring between the bracket in which the cursor is located and the one it's paired to). \nAfter the operation \"D\" the cursor moves to the nearest bracket to the right (of course, among the non-deleted). If there is no such bracket (that is, the suffix of the CBS was deleted), then the cursor moves to the nearest bracket to the left (of course, among the non-deleted). \n\nThere are pictures illustrated several usages of operation \"D\" below.\n\nAll incorrect operations (shift cursor over the end of CBS, delete the whole CBS, etc.) are not supported by Polycarp's editor.\n\nPolycarp is very proud of his development, can you implement the functionality of his editor?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three positive integers *n*, *m* and *p* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=500<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=500<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*p*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of brackets in the correct bracket sequence, the number of operations and the initial position of cursor. Positions in the sequence are numbered from left to right, starting from one. It is guaranteed that *n* is even.\n\nIt is followed by the string of *n* characters \"(\" and \")\" forming the correct bracket sequence.\n\nThen follow a string of *m* characters \"L\", \"R\" and \"D\"\u00a0\u2014 a sequence of the operations. Operations are carried out one by one from the first to the last. It is guaranteed that the given operations never move the cursor outside the bracket sequence, as well as the fact that after all operations a bracket sequence will be non-empty.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the correct bracket sequence, obtained as a result of applying all operations to the initial sequence.\n\nDemo Input:\n['8 4 5\\n(())()()\\nRDLD\\n', '12 5 3\\n((()())(()))\\nRRDLD\\n', '8 8 8\\n(())()()\\nLLLLLLDD\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['()\\n', '(()(()))\\n', '()()\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample the cursor is initially at position 5. Consider actions of the editor:\n 1.  command \"R\"\u00a0\u2014 the cursor moves to the position 6 on the right; 1.  command \"D\"\u00a0\u2014 the deletion of brackets from the position 5 to the position 6. After that CBS takes the form (())(), the cursor is at the position 5; 1.  command \"L\"\u00a0\u2014 the cursor moves to the position 4 on the left; 1.  command \"D\"\u00a0\u2014 the deletion of brackets from the position 1 to the position 4. After that CBS takes the form (), the cursor is at the position 1. \nThus, the answer is equal to ().",

        "prompt": "Title: Help Farmer\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOnce upon a time in the Kingdom of Far Far Away lived Sam the Farmer. Sam had a cow named Dawn and he was deeply attached to her. Sam would spend the whole summer stocking hay to feed Dawn in winter. Sam scythed hay and put it into haystack. As Sam was a bright farmer, he tried to make the process of storing hay simpler and more convenient to use. He collected the hay into cubical hay blocks of the same size. Then he stored the blocks in his barn. After a summer spent in hard toil Sam stored *A*\u00b7*B*\u00b7*C* hay blocks and stored them in a barn as a rectangular parallelepiped *A* layers high. Each layer had *B* rows and each row had *C* blocks.\n\nAt the end of the autumn Sam came into the barn to admire one more time the hay he'd been stacking during this hard summer. Unfortunately, Sam was horrified to see that the hay blocks had been carelessly scattered around the barn. The place was a complete mess. As it turned out, thieves had sneaked into the barn. They completely dissembled and took away a layer of blocks from the parallelepiped's front, back, top and sides. As a result, the barn only had a parallelepiped containing (*A*<=-<=1)<=\u00d7<=(*B*<=-<=2)<=\u00d7<=(*C*<=-<=2) hay blocks. To hide the evidence of the crime, the thieves had dissembled the parallelepiped into single 1<=\u00d7<=1<=\u00d7<=1 blocks and scattered them around the barn. After the theft Sam counted *n* hay blocks in the barn but he forgot numbers *A*, *B* \u0438 *C*.\n\nGiven number *n*, find the minimally possible and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe only line contains integer *n* from the problem's statement (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint space-separated minimum and maximum number of hay blocks that could have been stolen by the thieves.\n\nNote that the answer to the problem can be large enough, so you must use the 64-bit integer type for calculations. Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n', '7\\n', '12\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['28 41\\n', '47 65\\n', '48 105\\n']\n\nNote:\nLet's consider the first sample test. If initially Sam has a parallelepiped consisting of 32\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009\u00d7\u20094 hay blocks in his barn, then after the theft the barn has 4\u2009=\u2009(2\u2009-\u20091)\u2009\u00d7\u2009(4\u2009-\u20092)\u2009\u00d7\u2009(4\u2009-\u20092) hay blocks left. Thus, the thieves could have stolen 32\u2009-\u20094\u2009=\u200928 hay blocks. If Sam initially had a parallelepiped consisting of 45\u2009=\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093 hay blocks in his barn, then after the theft the barn has 4\u2009=\u2009(5\u2009-\u20091)\u2009\u00d7\u2009(3\u2009-\u20092)\u2009\u00d7\u2009(3\u2009-\u20092) hay blocks left. Thus, the thieves could have stolen 45\u2009-\u20094\u2009=\u200941 hay blocks.

        "prompt": "Title: Substring and Subsequence\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOne day Polycarpus got hold of two non-empty strings *s* and *t*, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Polycarpus is quite good with strings, so he immediately wondered, how many different pairs of \"*x* *y*\" are there, such that *x* is a substring of string *s*, *y* is a subsequence of string *t*, and the content of *x* and *y* is the same. Two pairs are considered different, if they contain different substrings of string *s* or different subsequences of string *t*. Read the whole statement to understand the definition of different substrings and subsequences.\n\nThe length of string *s* is the number of characters in it. If we denote the length of the string *s* as |*s*|, we can write the string as *s*<==<=*s*1*s*2... *s*|*s*|.\n\nA substring of *s* is a non-empty string *x*<==<=*s*[*a*... *b*]<==<=*s**a**s**a*<=+<=1... *s**b* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=|*s*|). For example, \"code\" and \"force\" are substrings or \"codeforces\", while \"coders\" is not. Two substrings *s*[*a*... *b*] and *s*[*c*... *d*] are considered to be different if *a*<=\u2260<=*c* or *b*<=\u2260<=*d*. For example, if *s*=\"codeforces\", *s*[2...2] and *s*[6...6] are different, though their content is the same.\n\nA subsequence of *s* is a non-empty string *y*<==<=*s*[*p*1*p*2... *p*|*y*|]<==<=*s**p*1*s**p*2... *s**p*|*y*| (1<=\u2264<=*p*1<=&lt;<=*p*2<=&lt;<=...<=&lt;<=*p*|*y*|<=\u2264<=|*s*|). For example, \"coders\" is a subsequence of \"codeforces\". Two subsequences *u*<==<=*s*[*p*1*p*2... *p*|*u*|] and *v*<==<=*s*[*q*1*q*2... *q*|*v*|] are considered different if the sequences *p* and *q* are different.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input consists of two lines. The first of them contains *s* (1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=5000), and the second one contains *t* (1<=\u2264<=|*t*|<=\u2264<=5000). Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number \u2014 the number of different pairs \"*x* *y*\" such that *x* is a substring of string *s*, *y* is a subsequence of string *t*, and the content of *x* and *y* is the same. As the answer can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\n\nDemo Input:\n['aa\\naa\\n', 'codeforces\\nforceofcode\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['5\\n', '60\\n']\n\nNote:\nLet's write down all pairs \"*x* *y*\" that form the answer in the first sample: \"*s*[1...1] *t*[1]\", \"*s*[2...2] *t*[1]\", \"*s*[1...1] *t*[2]\",\"*s*[2...2] *t*[2]\", \"*s*[1...2] *t*[1\u00a02]\".",

        "prompt": "Title: Dungeons and Candies\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nDuring the loading of the game \"Dungeons and Candies\" you are required to get descriptions of *k* levels from the server. Each description is a map of an *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* checkered rectangular field. Some cells of the field contain candies (each cell has at most one candy). An empty cell is denoted as \".\" on the map, but if a cell has a candy, it is denoted as a letter of the English alphabet. A level may contain identical candies, in this case the letters in the corresponding cells of the map will be the same.\n\nWhen you transmit information via a network, you want to minimize traffic \u2014 the total size of the transferred data. The levels can be transmitted in any order. There are two ways to transmit the current level *A*:\n 1.  You can transmit the whole level *A*. Then you need to transmit *n*\u00b7*m* bytes via the network. 1.  You can transmit the difference between level *A* and some previously transmitted level *B* (if it exists); this operation requires to transmit *d**A*,<=*B*\u00b7*w* bytes, where *d**A*,<=*B* is the number of cells of the field that are different for *A* and *B*, and *w* is a constant. Note, that you should compare only the corresponding cells of levels *A* and *B* to calculate *d**A*,<=*B*. You cannot transform the maps of levels, i.e. rotate or shift them relatively to each other. \nYour task is to find a way to transfer all the *k* levels and minimize the traffic.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains four integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*k*,<=*w* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=10;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*k*,<=*w*<=\u2264<=1000). Then follows the description of *k* levels. Each level is described by *n* lines, each line contains *m* characters. Each character is either a letter of the English alphabet or a dot (\".\"). Please note that the case of the letters matters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print the required minimum number of transferred bytes.\n\nThen print *k* pairs of integers *x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2,<=...,<=*x**k*,<=*y**k*, describing the way to transfer levels. Pair *x**i*, *y**i* means that level *x**i* needs to be transferred by way *y**i*. If *y**i* equals 0, that means that the level must be transferred using the first way, otherwise *y**i* must be equal to the number of a previously transferred level. It means that you will transfer the difference between levels *y**i* and *x**i* to transfer level *x**i*. Print the pairs in the order of transferring levels. The levels are numbered 1 through *k* in the order they follow in the input.\n\nIf there are multiple optimal solutions, you can print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 3 3 2\\nA.A\\n...\\nA.a\\n..C\\nX.Y\\n...\\n', '1 1 4 1\\nA\\n.\\nB\\n.\\n', '1 3 5 2\\nABA\\nBBB\\nBBA\\nBAB\\nABB\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['14\\n1 0\\n2 1\\n3 1\\n', '3\\n1 0\\n2 0\\n4 2\\n3 0\\n', '11\\n1 0\\n3 1\\n2 3\\n4 2\\n5 1\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

They often are in different rooms of the office in different cities and even countries. To keep in touch and track the results of the project, the F company conducts shared online meetings in a Spyke chat.\n\nOne day the director of the F company got hold of the records of a part of an online meeting of one successful team. The director watched the record and wanted to talk to the team leader. But how can he tell who the leader is? The director logically supposed that the leader is the person who is present at any conversation during a chat meeting. In other words, if at some moment of time at least one person is present on the meeting, then the leader is present on the meeting.\n\nYou are the assistant director. Given the 'user logged on'/'user logged off' messages of the meeting in the chronological order, help the director determine who can be the leader.

To save energy, the stove in the kitchen automatically turns off after *k* minutes after turning on.\n\nDuring cooking, Julia goes to the kitchen every *d* minutes and turns on the stove if it is turned off. While the cooker is turned off, it stays warm. The stove switches on and off instantly.\n\nIt is known that the chicken needs *t* minutes to be cooked on the stove, if it is turned on, and 2*t* minutes, if it is turned off. You need to find out, how much time will Julia have to cook the chicken, if it is considered that the chicken is cooked evenly, with constant speed when the stove is turned on and at a constant speed when it is turned off.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe single line contains three integers *k*, *d* and *t* (1<=\u2264<=*k*,<=*d*,<=*t*<=\u2264<=1018).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number, the total time of cooking in minutes. The relative or absolute error must not exceed 10<=-<=9.\n\nNamely, let's assume that your answer is *x* and the answer of the jury is *y*. The checker program will consider your answer correct if .\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 2 6\\n', '4 2 20\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['6.5\\n', '20.0\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example, the chicken will be cooked for 3 minutes on the turned on stove, after this it will be cooked for <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/cce5d3f2f46552034d5ae5d487725705429ec7a5.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.

We are interested in all possible pairs of numbers (*a**i*, *a**j*), (1<=\u2264<=*i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*). In other words, let's consider all *n*2 pairs of numbers, picked from the given array.\n\nFor example, in sequence *a*<==<={3,<=1,<=5} are 9 pairs of numbers: (3,<=3),<=(3,<=1),<=(3,<=5),<=(1,<=3),<=(1,<=1),<=(1,<=5),<=(5,<=3),<=(5,<=1),<=(5,<=5).\n\nLet's sort all resulting pairs lexicographically by non-decreasing. Let us remind you that pair (*p*1, *q*1) is lexicographically less than pair (*p*2, *q*2) only if either *p*1 &lt; *p*2, or *p*1 = *p*2 and *q*1 &lt; *q*2.\n\nThen the sequence, mentioned above, will be sorted like that: (1,<=1),<=(1,<=3),<=(1,<=5),<=(3,<=1),<=(3,<=3),<=(3,<=5),<=(5,<=1),<=(5,<=3),<=(5,<=5)\n\nLet's number all the pair in the sorted list from 1 to *n*2.

        "prompt": "Title: New Year Cards\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nAs meticulous Gerald sets the table, Alexander finished another post on Codeforces and begins to respond to New Year greetings from friends. Alexander has *n* friends, and each of them sends to Alexander exactly one e-card. Let us number his friends by numbers from 1 to *n* in the order in which they send the cards. Let's introduce the same numbering for the cards, that is, according to the numbering the *i*-th friend sent to Alexander a card number *i*.\n\nAlexander also sends cards to friends, but he doesn't look for the new cards on the Net. He simply uses the cards previously sent to him (sometimes, however, he does need to add some crucial details). Initially Alexander doesn't have any cards. Alexander always follows the two rules:\n 1.  He will never send to a firend a card that this friend has sent to him. 1.  Among the other cards available to him at the moment, Alexander always chooses one that Alexander himself likes most. \nAlexander plans to send to each friend exactly one card. Of course, Alexander can send the same card multiple times.\n\nAlexander and each his friend has the list of preferences, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*. The first number in the list is the number of the favorite card, the second number shows the second favorite, and so on, the last number shows the least favorite card.\n\nYour task is to find a schedule of sending cards for Alexander. Determine at which moments of time Alexander must send cards to his friends, to please each of them as much as possible. In other words, so that as a result of applying two Alexander's rules, each friend receives the card that is preferred for him as much as possible.\n\nNote that Alexander doesn't choose freely what card to send, but he always strictly follows the two rules.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=300) \u2014 the number of Alexander's friends, equal to the number of cards. Next *n* lines contain his friends' preference lists. Each list consists of *n* different integers from 1 to *n*. The last line contains Alexander's preference list in the same format.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *n* space-separated numbers: the *i*-th number should be the number of the friend, whose card Alexander receives right before he should send a card to the *i*-th friend. If there are several solutions, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n1 2 3 4\\n4 1 3 2\\n4 3 1 2\\n3 4 2 1\\n3 1 2 4\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2 1 1 4\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the sample, the algorithm of actions Alexander and his friends perform is as follows: \n 1.  Alexander receives card 1 from the first friend. 1.  Alexander sends the card he has received (at the moment he only has one card, and therefore it is the most preferable for him) to friends with the numbers 2 and 3. 1.  Alexander receives card 2 from the second friend, now he has two cards \u2014 1 and 2. 1.  Alexander sends a card to the first friend. Despite the fact that Alexander likes card 1 more, he sends card 2 as he cannot send a friend the card sent by that very friend. 1.  Alexander receives card 3 from the third friend. 1.  Alexander receives card 4 from the fourth friend. 1.  Among the cards Alexander has number 3 is his favorite and he sends it to the fourth friend. \nNote that Alexander can send cards to multiple friends at a time (in this case the second and the third one). Alexander can send card 3 to the fourth friend after he receives the third card or after he receives the fourth card (both variants are correct).",

Add the integer *x**i* to the first *a**i* elements of the sequence. 1.  Append an integer *k**i* to the end of the sequence. (And hence the size of the sequence increases by 1) 1.  Remove the last element of the sequence. So, the size of the sequence decreases by one.

        "prompt": "Title: Two Strings Swaps\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nYou are given two strings $a$ and $b$ consisting of lowercase English letters, both of length $n$. The characters of both strings have indices from $1$ to $n$, inclusive. \n\nYou are allowed to do the following changes: \n -  Choose any index $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) and swap characters $a_i$ and $b_i$; -  Choose any index $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) and swap characters $a_i$ and $a_{n - i + 1}$; -  Choose any index $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) and swap characters $b_i$ and $b_{n - i + 1}$. \nNote that if $n$ is odd, you are formally allowed to swap $a_{\\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\rceil}$ with $a_{\\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\rceil}$ (and the same with the string $b$) but this move is useless. Also you can swap two equal characters but this operation is useless as well.\n\nYou have to make these strings equal by applying any number of changes described above, in any order. But it is obvious that it may be impossible to make two strings equal by these swaps.\n\nIn one preprocess move you can replace a character in $a$ with another character. In other words, in a single preprocess move you can choose any index $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$), any character $c$ and set $a_i := c$.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of preprocess moves to apply in such a way that after them you can make strings $a$ and $b$ equal by applying some number of changes described in the list above.\n\nNote that the number of changes you make after the preprocess moves does not matter. Also note that you cannot apply preprocess moves to the string $b$ or make any preprocess moves after the first change is made.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the length of strings $a$ and $b$.\n\nThe second line contains the string $a$ consisting of exactly $n$ lowercase English letters.\n\nThe third line contains the string $b$ consisting of exactly $n$ lowercase English letters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of preprocess moves to apply before changes, so that it is possible to make the string $a$ equal to string $b$ with a sequence of changes from the list above.\n\nDemo Input:\n['7\\nabacaba\\nbacabaa\\n', '5\\nzcabd\\ndbacz\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example preprocess moves are as follows: $a_1 := $'b', $a_3 := $'c', $a_4 := $'a' and $a_5:=$'b'. Afterwards, $a = $\"bbcabba\". Then we can obtain equal strings by the following sequence of changes: $swap(a_2, b_2)$ and $swap(a_2, a_6)$. There is no way to use fewer than $4$ preprocess moves before a sequence of changes to make string equal, so the answer in this example is $4$.\n\nIn the second example no preprocess moves are required. We can use the following sequence of changes to make $a$ and $b$ equal: $swap(b_1, b_5)$, $swap(a_2, a_4)$.",

        "prompt": "Title: Anton and Fairy Tale\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nAnton likes to listen to fairy tales, especially when Danik, Anton's best friend, tells them. Right now Danik tells Anton a fairy tale:\n\n\"Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...\"\n\nMore formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of *n* grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:\n -  *m* grains are brought to the barn. If *m* grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account). -  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the *i*-th day *i* sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. \nAnton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn. Anton doesn't know when the fairy tale ends, so he asked you to determine, by the end of which day the barn will become empty for the first time. Help Anton and write a program that will determine the number of that day!\n\nInput Specification:\nThe only line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=1018)\u00a0\u2014 the capacity of the barn and the number of grains that are brought every day.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of the day when the barn will become empty for the first time. Days are numbered starting with one.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 2\\n', '8 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4\\n', '5\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample the capacity of the barn is five grains and two grains are brought every day. The following happens:\n -  At the beginning of the first day grain is brought to the barn. It's full, so nothing happens. -  At the end of the first day one sparrow comes and eats one grain, so 5\u2009-\u20091\u2009=\u20094 grains remain. -  At the beginning of the second day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it. -  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5\u2009-\u20092\u2009=\u20093 grains remain. -  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full again. -  At the end of the third day three sparrows come and eat grain. 5\u2009-\u20093\u2009=\u20092 grains remain. -  At the beginning of the fourth day grain is brought again. 2\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u20094 grains remain. -  At the end of the fourth day four sparrows come and eat grain. 4\u2009-\u20094\u2009=\u20090 grains remain. The barn is empty. \nSo the answer is 4, because by the end of the fourth day the barn becomes empty.",

There are many ways to represent such a tree. One way is to create an array with *n* integers *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*, where *p**i* denotes a parent of vertex *i* (here, for convenience a root is considered its own parent).\n\nGiven a sequence *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*, one is able to restore a tree:\n 1.  There must be exactly one index *r* that *p**r*<==<=*r*. A vertex *r* is a root of the tree. 1.  For all other *n*<=-<=1 vertices *i*, there is an edge between vertex *i* and vertex *p**i*. \nA sequence *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* is called valid if the described procedure generates some (any) rooted tree. For example, for *n*<==<=3 sequences (1,2,2), (2,3,1) and (2,1,3) are not valid.\n\nYou are given a sequence *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, not necessarily valid. Your task is to change the minimum number of elements, in order to get a valid sequence. Print the minimum number of changes and an example of a valid sequence after that number of changes. If there are many valid sequences achievable in the minimum number of changes, print any of them.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains an integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print the minimum number of elements to change, in order to get a valid sequence.\n\nIn the second line, print any valid sequence possible to get from (*a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*) in the minimum number of changes.

He liked the present he got from Seryozha even more. \n\nDima felt so grateful to Inna about the present that he decided to buy her *n* hares. Inna was very happy. She lined up the hares in a row, numbered them from 1 to *n* from left to right and started feeding them with carrots. Inna was determined to feed each hare exactly once. But in what order should she feed them?\n\nInna noticed that each hare radiates joy when she feeds it. And the joy of the specific hare depends on whether Inna fed its adjacent hares before feeding it. Inna knows how much joy a hare radiates if it eats when either both of his adjacent hares are hungry, or one of the adjacent hares is full (that is, has been fed), or both of the adjacent hares are full. Please note that hares number 1 and *n* don't have a left and a right-adjacent hare correspondingly, so they can never have two full adjacent hares.\n\nHelp Inna maximize the total joy the hares radiate. :)\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3000) \u2014 the number of hares.

The following limits are fulfilled: 0<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*,<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=105.\n\nNumber *a**i* in the first line shows the joy that hare number *i* gets if his adjacent hares are both hungry. Number *b**i* in the second line shows the joy that hare number *i* radiates if he has exactly one full adjacent hare. Number *\u0441**i* in the third line shows the joy that hare number *i* radiates if both his adjacent hares are full.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn a single line, print the maximum possible total joy of the hares Inna can get by feeding them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n1 2 3 4\\n4 3 2 1\\n0 1 1 0\\n', '7\\n8 5 7 6 1 8 9\\n2 7 9 5 4 3 1\\n2 3 3 4 1 1 3\\n', '3\\n1 1 1\\n1 2 1\\n1 1 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['13\\n', '44\\n', '4\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Discounts\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOne day Polycarpus stopped by a supermarket on his way home. It turns out that the supermarket is having a special offer for stools. The offer is as follows: if a customer's shopping cart contains at least one stool, the customer gets a 50% discount on the cheapest item in the cart (that is, it becomes two times cheaper). If there are several items with the same minimum price, the discount is available for only one of them!\n\nPolycarpus has *k* carts, and he wants to buy up all stools and pencils from the supermarket. Help him distribute the stools and the pencils among the shopping carts, so that the items' total price (including the discounts) is the least possible.\n\nPolycarpus must use all *k* carts to purchase the items, no shopping cart can remain empty. Each shopping cart can contain an arbitrary number of stools and/or pencils.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=103) \u2014 the number of items in the supermarket and the number of carts, correspondingly. Next *n* lines describe the items as \"*c**i* *t**i*\" (without the quotes), where *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=109) is an integer denoting the price of the *i*-th item, *t**i* (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=2) is an integer representing the type of item *i* (1 for a stool and 2 for a pencil). The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print a single real number with exactly one  decimal place \u2014 the minimum total price of the items, including the discounts.\n\nIn the following *k* lines print the descriptions of the items in the carts. In the *i*-th line print the description of the *i*-th cart as \"*t* *b*1 *b*2 ... *b**t*\" (without the quotes), where *t* is the number of items in the *i*-th cart, and the sequence *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**t* (1<=\u2264<=*b**j*<=\u2264<=*n*) gives the indices of items to put in this cart in the optimal distribution. All indices of items in all carts should be pairwise different, each item must belong to exactly one cart. You can print the items in carts and the carts themselves in any order. The items are numbered from 1 to *n* in the order in which they are specified in the input.\n\nIf there are multiple optimal distributions, you are allowed to print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 2\\n2 1\\n3 2\\n3 1\\n', '4 3\\n4 1\\n1 2\\n2 2\\n3 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['5.5\\n2 1 2\\n1 3\\n', '8.0\\n1 1\\n2 4 2\\n1 3\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample case the first cart should contain the 1st and 2nd items, and the second cart should contain the 3rd item. This way each cart has a stool and each cart has a 50% discount for the cheapest item. The total price of all items will be: 2\u00b70.5\u2009+\u2009(3\u2009+\u20093\u00b70.5)\u2009=\u20091\u2009+\u20094.5\u2009=\u20095.5.",

Each character of Kevin's string represents Kevin's score on one of the *n* questions of the olympiad\u2014'1' for a correctly identified cow and '0' otherwise.\n\nHowever, all is not lost. Kevin is a big proponent of alternative thinking and believes that his score, instead of being the sum of his points, should be the length of the longest alternating subsequence of his string. Here, we define an alternating subsequence of a string as a not-necessarily contiguous subsequence where no two consecutive elements are equal. For example, {0,<=1,<=0,<=1}, {1,<=0,<=1}, and {1,<=0,<=1,<=0} are alternating sequences, while {1,<=0,<=0} and {0,<=1,<=0,<=1,<=1} are not.\n\nKevin, being the sneaky little puffball that he is, is willing to hack into the USAICO databases to improve his score. In order to be subtle, he decides that he will flip exactly one substring\u2014that is, take a contiguous non-empty substring of his score and change all '0's in that substring to '1's and vice versa. After such an operation, Kevin wants to know the length of the longest possible alternating subsequence that his string could have.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains the number of questions on the olympiad *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000).\n\nThe following line contains a binary string of length *n* representing Kevin's results on the USAICO.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput a single integer, the length of the longest possible alternating subsequence that Kevin can create in his string after flipping a single substring.\n\nDemo Input:\n['8\\n10000011\\n', '2\\n01\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['5\\n', '2\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, Kevin can flip the bolded substring '10000011' and turn his string into '10011011', which has an alternating subsequence of length 5: '10011011'.\n\nIn the second sample, Kevin can flip the entire string and still have the same score.",

By the arrival of the President of Berland these trees were decided to be changed so that their heights formed a beautiful sequence. This means that the heights of trees on ends (the 1st one and the *n*-th one) should be equal to each other, the heights of the 2-nd and the (*n*<=-<=1)-th tree must also be equal to each other, at that the height of the 2-nd tree should be larger than the height of the first tree by 1, and so on. In other words, the heights of the trees, standing at equal distance from the edge (of one end of the sequence) must be equal to each other, and with the increasing of the distance from the edge by 1 the tree height must also increase by 1. For example, the sequences \"2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2\" and \"1 2 3 2 1\" are beautiful, and '1 3 3 1\" and \"1 2 3 1\" are not. \n\nChanging the height of a tree is a very expensive operation, using advanced technologies invented by Berland scientists. In one operation you can choose any tree and change its height to any number, either increase or decrease.

        "prompt": "Title: Longtail Hedgehog\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThis Christmas Santa gave Masha a magic picture and a pencil. The picture consists of *n* points connected by *m* segments (they might cross in any way, that doesn't matter). No two segments connect the same pair of points, and no segment connects the point to itself. Masha wants to color some segments in order paint a hedgehog. In Mashas mind every hedgehog consists of a tail and some spines. She wants to paint the tail that satisfies the following conditions: \n 1.  Only segments already presented on the picture can be painted; 1.  The tail should be continuous, i.e. consists of some sequence of points, such that every two neighbouring points are connected by a colored segment; 1.  The numbers of points from the beginning of the tail to the end should strictly increase. \nMasha defines the length of the tail as the number of points in it. Also, she wants to paint some spines. To do so, Masha will paint all the segments, such that one of their ends is the endpoint of the tail. Masha defines the beauty of a hedgehog as the length of the tail multiplied by the number of spines. Masha wants to color the most beautiful hedgehog. Help her calculate what result she may hope to get.\n\nNote that according to Masha's definition of a hedgehog, one segment may simultaneously serve as a spine and a part of the tail (she is a little girl after all). Take a look at the picture for further clarifications.\n\nInput Specification:\nFirst line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m*(2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=200<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of points and the number segments on the picture respectively. \n\nThen follow *m* lines, each containing two integers *u**i* and *v**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *u**i*<=\u2260<=*v**i*)\u00a0\u2014 the numbers of points connected by corresponding segment. It's guaranteed that no two segments connect the same pair of points.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the maximum possible value of the hedgehog's beauty.\n\nDemo Input:\n['8 6\\n4 5\\n3 5\\n2 5\\n1 2\\n2 8\\n6 7\\n', '4 6\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n1 4\\n2 3\\n2 4\\n3 4\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['9\\n', '12\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe picture below corresponds to the first sample. Segments that form the hedgehog are painted red. The tail consists of a sequence of points with numbers 1, 2 and 5. The following segments are spines: (2, 5), (3, 5) and (4, 5). Therefore, the beauty of the hedgehog is equal to 3\u00b73\u2009=\u20099.\n\n<img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/b3601595b30564928c0ce72c4d371941925f12e3.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>",

        "prompt": "Title: Love Rescue\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nValya and Tolya are an ideal pair, but they quarrel sometimes. Recently, Valya took offense at her boyfriend because he came to her in t-shirt with lettering that differs from lettering on her pullover. Now she doesn't want to see him and Tolya is seating at his room and crying at her photos all day long.\n\nThis story could be very sad but fairy godmother (Tolya's grandmother) decided to help them and restore their relationship. She secretly took Tolya's t-shirt and Valya's pullover and wants to make the letterings on them same. In order to do this, for one unit of mana she can buy a spell that can change some letters on the clothes. Your task is calculate the minimum amount of mana that Tolya's grandmother should spend to rescue love of Tolya and Valya.\n\nMore formally, letterings on Tolya's t-shirt and Valya's pullover are two strings with same length *n* consisting only of lowercase English letters. Using one unit of mana, grandmother can buy a spell of form (*c*1,<=*c*2) (where *c*1 and *c*2 are some lowercase English letters), which can arbitrary number of times transform a single letter *c*1 to *c*2 and vise-versa on both Tolya's t-shirt and Valya's pullover. You should find the minimum amount of mana that grandmother should spend to buy a set of spells that can make the letterings equal. In addition you should output the required set of spells.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the length of the letterings.\n\nThe second line contains a string with length *n*, consisting of lowercase English letters\u00a0\u2014 the lettering on Valya's pullover.\n\nThe third line contains the lettering on Tolya's t-shirt in the same format.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line output a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum amount of mana *t* required for rescuing love of Valya and Tolya.\n\nIn the next *t* lines output pairs of space-separated lowercase English letters\u00a0\u2014 spells that Tolya's grandmother should buy. Spells and letters in spells can be printed in any order.\n\nIf there are many optimal answers, output any.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\nabb\\ndad\\n', '8\\ndrpepper\\ncocacola\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\na d\\nb a', '7\\nl e\\ne d\\nd c\\nc p\\np o\\no r\\nr a\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn first example it's enough to buy two spells: ('a','d') and ('b','a').

That grid's size is *n*<=\u00d7<=*m*. Let's denote the coordinate system on the grid. So, each point on the grid will have coordinates \u2014 a pair of integers (*x*,<=*y*) (0<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=0<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nYour task is to find a maximum sub-rectangle on the grid (*x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2) so that it contains the given point (*x*,<=*y*), and its length-width ratio is exactly (*a*,<=*b*). In other words the following conditions must hold: 0<=\u2264<=*x*1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*x*2<=\u2264<=*n*, 0<=\u2264<=*y*1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*y*2<=\u2264<=*m*, .\n\nThe sides of this sub-rectangle should be parallel to the axes. And values *x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2 should be integers.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, find the rectangle which is closest to (*x*,<=*y*). Here \"closest\" means the Euclid distance between (*x*,<=*y*) and the center of the rectangle is as small as possible. If there are still multiple solutions, find the lexicographically minimum one. Here \"lexicographically minimum\" means that we should consider the sub-rectangle as sequence of integers (*x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2), so we can choose the lexicographically minimum one.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains six integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*x*,<=*y*,<=*a*,<=*b* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109,<=0<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=0<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*,<=1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint four integers *x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2, which represent the founded sub-rectangle whose left-bottom point is (*x*1,<=*y*1) and right-up point is (*x*2,<=*y*2).\n\nDemo Input:\n['9 9 5 5 2 1\\n', '100 100 52 50 46 56\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1 3 9 7\\n', '17 8 86 92\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Phillip and Trains\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe mobile application store has a new game called \"Subway Roller\".\n\nThe protagonist of the game Philip is located in one end of the tunnel and wants to get out of the other one. The tunnel is a rectangular field consisting of three rows and *n* columns. At the beginning of the game the hero is in some cell of the leftmost column. Some number of trains rides towards the hero. Each train consists of two or more neighbouring cells in some row of the field.\n\nAll trains are moving from right to left at a speed of two cells per second, and the hero runs from left to right at the speed of one cell per second. For simplicity, the game is implemented so that the hero and the trains move in turns. First, the hero moves one cell to the right, then one square up or down, or stays idle. Then all the trains move twice simultaneously one cell to the left. Thus, in one move, Philip definitely makes a move to the right and can move up or down. If at any point, Philip is in the same cell with a train, he loses. If the train reaches the left column, it continues to move as before, leaving the tunnel.\n\nYour task is to answer the question whether there is a sequence of movements of Philip, such that he would be able to get to the rightmost column.\n\nInput Specification:\nEach test contains from one to ten sets of the input data. The first line of the test contains a single integer *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=10 for pretests and tests or *t*<==<=1 for hacks; see the Notes section for details) \u2014 the number of sets.\n\nThen follows the description of *t* sets of the input data. \n\nThe first line of the description of each set contains two integers *n*,<=*k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=26) \u2014 the number of columns on the field and the number of trains. Each of the following three lines contains the sequence of *n* character, representing the row of the field where the game is on. Philip's initial position is marked as 's', he is in the leftmost column. Each of the *k* trains is marked by some sequence of identical uppercase letters of the English alphabet, located in one line. Distinct trains are represented by distinct letters. Character '.' represents an empty cell, that is, the cell that doesn't contain either Philip or the trains.\n\nOutput Specification:\nFor each set of the input data print on a single line word YES, if it is possible to win the game and word NO otherwise.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2\\n16 4\\n...AAAAA........\\ns.BBB......CCCCC\\n........DDDDD...\\n16 4\\n...AAAAA........\\ns.BBB....CCCCC..\\n.......DDDDD....\\n', '2\\n10 4\\ns.ZZ......\\n.....AAABB\\n.YYYYYY...\\n10 4\\ns.ZZ......\\n....AAAABB\\n.YYYYYY...\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\nNO\\n', 'YES\\nNO\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first set of the input of the first sample Philip must first go forward and go down to the third row of the field, then go only forward, then go forward and climb to the second row, go forward again and go up to the first row. After that way no train blocks Philip's path, so he can go straight to the end of the tunnel.\n\nNote that in this problem the challenges are restricted to tests that contain only one testset.",

        "prompt": "Title: Phone Number\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nAlas, finding one's true love is not easy. Masha has been unsuccessful in that yet. Her friend Dasha told Masha about a way to determine the phone number of one's Prince Charming through arithmancy. \n\nThe phone number is divined like that. First one needs to write down one's own phone numbers. For example, let's suppose that Masha's phone number is 12345. After that one should write her favorite digit from 0 to 9 under the first digit of her number. That will be the first digit of the needed number. For example, Masha's favorite digit is 9. The second digit is determined as a half sum of the second digit of Masha's number and the already written down first digit from her beloved one's number. In this case the arithmetic average equals to (2<=+<=9)<=/<=2<==<=5.5. Masha can round the number up or down, depending on her wishes. For example, she chooses the digit 5. Having written down the resulting digit under the second digit of her number, Masha moves to finding the third digit in the same way, i.e. finding the half sum the the third digit of her number and the second digit of the new number. The result is (5<=+<=3)<=/<=2<==<=4. In this case the answer is unique. Thus, every *i*-th digit is determined as an arithmetic average of the *i*-th digit of Masha's number and the *i*<=-<=1-th digit of her true love's number. If needed, the digit can be rounded up or down. For example, Masha can get:\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains nonempty sequence consisting of digits from 0 to 9 \u2014 Masha's phone number.

Vertex *p**i* has coordinates (*x**i*,<=*y**i*) in the 2D plane. These vertices are listed in clockwise order.\n\nYou can choose a real number *D* and move each vertex of the polygon a distance of at most *D* from their original positions.\n\nFind the maximum value of *D* such that no matter how you move the vertices, the polygon does not intersect itself and stays convex.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line has one integer *n* (4<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices.\n\nThe next *n* lines contain the coordinates of the vertices.

        "prompt": "Title: An impassioned circulation of affection\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nNadeko's birthday is approaching! As she decorated the room for the party, a long garland of Dianthus-shaped paper pieces was placed on a prominent part of the wall. Brother Koyomi will like it!\n\nStill unsatisfied with the garland, Nadeko decided to polish it again. The garland has *n* pieces numbered from 1 to *n* from left to right, and the *i*-th piece has a colour *s**i*, denoted by a lowercase English letter. Nadeko will repaint at most *m* of the pieces to give each of them an arbitrary new colour (still denoted by a lowercase English letter). After this work, she finds out all subsegments of the garland containing pieces of only colour *c* \u2014 Brother Koyomi's favourite one, and takes the length of the longest among them to be the Koyomity of the garland.\n\nFor instance, let's say the garland is represented by \"kooomo\", and Brother Koyomi's favourite colour is \"o\". Among all subsegments containing pieces of \"o\" only, \"ooo\" is the longest, with a length of 3. Thus the Koyomity of this garland equals 3.\n\nBut problem arises as Nadeko is unsure about Brother Koyomi's favourite colour, and has swaying ideas on the amount of work to do. She has *q* plans on this, each of which can be expressed as a pair of an integer *m**i* and a lowercase letter *c**i*, meanings of which are explained above. You are to find out the maximum Koyomity achievable after repainting the garland according to each plan.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1<=500) \u2014 the length of the garland.\n\nThe second line contains *n* lowercase English letters *s*1*s*2... *s**n* as a string \u2014 the initial colours of paper pieces on the garland.\n\nThe third line contains a positive integer *q* (1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=200<=000) \u2014 the number of plans Nadeko has.\n\nThe next *q* lines describe one plan each: the *i*-th among them contains an integer *m**i* (1<=\u2264<=*m**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the maximum amount of pieces to repaint, followed by a space, then by a lowercase English letter *c**i* \u2014 Koyomi's possible favourite colour.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput *q* lines: for each work plan, output one line containing an integer \u2014 the largest Koyomity achievable after repainting the garland according to it.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6\\nkoyomi\\n3\\n1 o\\n4 o\\n4 m\\n', '15\\nyamatonadeshiko\\n10\\n1 a\\n2 a\\n3 a\\n4 a\\n5 a\\n1 b\\n2 b\\n3 b\\n4 b\\n5 b\\n', '10\\naaaaaaaaaa\\n2\\n10 b\\n10 z\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n6\\n5\\n', '3\\n4\\n5\\n7\\n8\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n', '10\\n10\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, there are three plans: \n -  In the first plan, at most 1 piece can be repainted. Repainting the \"y\" piece to become \"o\" results in \"kooomi\", whose Koyomity of 3 is the best achievable; -  In the second plan, at most 4 pieces can be repainted, and \"oooooo\" results in a Koyomity of 6; -  In the third plan, at most 4 pieces can be repainted, and \"mmmmmi\" and \"kmmmmm\" both result in a Koyomity of 5.",

To make the goal of catching them even harder, they use their own watches.\n\nFirst, as they know that kingdom police is bad at math, robbers use the positional numeral system with base 7. Second, they divide one day in *n* hours, and each hour in *m* minutes. Personal watches of each robber are divided in two parts: first of them has the smallest possible number of places that is necessary to display any integer from 0 to *n*<=-<=1, while the second has the smallest possible number of places that is necessary to display any integer from 0 to *m*<=-<=1. Finally, if some value of hours or minutes can be displayed using less number of places in base 7 than this watches have, the required number of zeroes is added at the beginning of notation.\n\nNote that to display number 0 section of the watches is required to have at least one place.\n\nLittle robber wants to know the number of moments of time (particular values of hours and minutes), such that all digits displayed on the watches are distinct. Help her calculate this number.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers, given in the decimal notation, *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 the number of hours in one day and the number of minutes in one hour, respectively.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint one integer in decimal notation\u00a0\u2014 the number of different pairs of hour and minute, such that all digits displayed on the watches are distinct.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 3\\n', '8 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4\\n', '5\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, possible pairs are: (0:\u20091), (0:\u20092), (1:\u20090), (1:\u20092).\n\nIn the second sample, possible pairs are: (02:\u20091), (03:\u20091), (04:\u20091), (05:\u20091), (06:\u20091).",

        "prompt": "Title: Vasya and Chess\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nVasya decided to learn to play chess. Classic chess doesn't seem interesting to him, so he plays his own sort of chess.\n\nThe queen is the piece that captures all squares on its vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines. If the cell is located on the same vertical, horizontal or diagonal line with queen, and the cell contains a piece of the enemy color, the queen is able to move to this square. After that the enemy's piece is removed from the board. The queen cannot move to a cell containing an enemy piece if there is some other piece between it and the queen. \n\nThere is an *n*<=\u00d7<=*n* chessboard. We'll denote a cell on the intersection of the *r*-th row and *c*-th column as (*r*,<=*c*). The square (1,<=1) contains the white queen and the square (1,<=*n*) contains the black queen. All other squares contain green pawns that don't belong to anyone.\n\nThe players move in turns. The player that moves first plays for the white queen, his opponent plays for the black queen.\n\nOn each move the player has to capture some piece with his queen (that is, move to a square that contains either a green pawn or the enemy queen). The player loses if either he cannot capture any piece during his move or the opponent took his queen during the previous move. \n\nHelp Vasya determine who wins if both players play with an optimal strategy on the board *n*<=\u00d7<=*n*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input contains a single number *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the size of the board.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOn the first line print the answer to problem \u2014 string \"white\" or string \"black\", depending on who wins if the both players play optimally. \n\nIf the answer is \"white\", then you should also print two integers *r* and *c* representing the cell (*r*,<=*c*), where the first player should make his first move to win. If there are multiple such cells, print the one with the minimum *r*. If there are still multiple squares, print the one with the minimum *c*.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2\\n', '3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['white\\n1 2\\n', 'black\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample test the white queen can capture the black queen at the first move, so the white player wins.\n\nIn the second test from the statement if the white queen captures the green pawn located on the central vertical line, then it will be captured by the black queen during the next move. So the only move for the white player is to capture the green pawn located at (2,\u20091). \n\nSimilarly, the black queen doesn't have any other options but to capture the green pawn located at (2,\u20093), otherwise if it goes to the middle vertical line, it will be captured by the white queen.\n\nDuring the next move the same thing happens \u2014 neither the white, nor the black queen has other options rather than to capture green pawns situated above them. Thus, the white queen ends up on square (3,\u20091), and the black queen ends up on square (3,\u20093). \n\nIn this situation the white queen has to capture any of the green pawns located on the middle vertical line, after that it will be captured by the black queen. Thus, the player who plays for the black queen wins.",

        "prompt": "Title: Coloring Trees\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon has arrived at Udayland! They walked in the park where *n* trees grow. They decided to be naughty and color the trees in the park. The trees are numbered with integers from 1 to *n* from left to right.\n\nInitially, tree *i* has color *c**i*. ZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon recognizes only *m* different colors, so 0<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*m*, where *c**i*<==<=0 means that tree *i* is uncolored.\n\nZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon decides to color only the uncolored trees, i.e. the trees with *c**i*<==<=0. They can color each of them them in any of the *m* colors from 1 to *m*. Coloring the *i*-th tree with color *j* requires exactly *p**i*,<=*j* litres of paint.\n\nThe two friends define the beauty of a coloring of the trees as the minimum number of contiguous groups (each group contains some subsegment of trees) you can split all the *n* trees into so that each group contains trees of the same color. For example, if the colors of the trees from left to right are 2,<=1,<=1,<=1,<=3,<=2,<=2,<=3,<=1,<=3, the beauty of the coloring is 7, since we can partition the trees into 7 contiguous groups of the same color : {2},<={1,<=1,<=1},<={3},<={2,<=2},<={3},<={1},<={3}. \n\nZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon wants to color all uncolored trees so that the beauty of the coloring is exactly *k*. They need your help to determine the minimum amount of paint (in litres) needed to finish the job.\n\nPlease note that the friends can't color the trees that are already colored.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers, *n*, *m* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of trees, number of colors and beauty of the resulting coloring respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *c*1,<=*c*2,<=...,<=*c**n* (0<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*m*), the initial colors of the trees. *c**i* equals to 0 if the tree number *i* is uncolored, otherwise the *i*-th tree has color *c**i*.\n\nThen *n* lines follow. Each of them contains *m* integers. The *j*-th number on the *i*-th of them line denotes *p**i*,<=*j* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 the amount of litres the friends need to color *i*-th tree with color *j*. *p**i*,<=*j*'s are specified even for the initially colored trees, but such trees still can't be colored.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer, the minimum amount of paint needed to color the trees. If there are no valid tree colorings of beauty *k*, print <=-<=1.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 2 2\\n0 0 0\\n1 2\\n3 4\\n5 6\\n', '3 2 2\\n2 1 2\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n3 5\\n', '3 2 2\\n2 0 0\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n3 5\\n', '3 2 3\\n2 1 2\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n3 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['10', '-1', '5', '0']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample case, coloring the trees with colors 2,\u20091,\u20091 minimizes the amount of paint used, which equals to 2\u2009+\u20093\u2009+\u20095\u2009=\u200910. Note that 1,\u20091,\u20091 would not be valid because the beauty of such coloring equals to 1 ({1,\u20091,\u20091} is a way to group the trees into a single group of the same color).\n\nIn the second sample case, all the trees are colored, but the beauty of the coloring is 3, so there is no valid coloring, and the answer is \u2009-\u20091.\n\nIn the last sample case, all the trees are colored and the beauty of the coloring matches *k*, so no paint is used and the answer is 0.",

He puts down the lifted books without changing their order. 1.  After reading book *x*, he puts book *x* on the top of the stack. \n \n\nHe decided to read books for *m* days.

To read the book, he has to use the process described in the paragraph above. It is possible that he decides to re-read the same book several times.\n\nAfter making this plan, he realized that the total weight of books he should lift during *m* days would be too heavy. So, he decided to change the order of the stacked books before the New Year comes, and minimize the total weight. You may assume that books can be stacked in any possible order.

More formally, elements satisfy the following conditions: *l*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*r* and *l*<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*r*. About sequence *c* we know that all its elements are distinct.\n\nDasha wrote a solution to that problem quickly, but checking her work on the standard test was not so easy. Due to an error in the test system only the sequence *a* and the compressed sequence of the sequence *c* were known from that test.\n\nLet's give the definition to a compressed sequence. A compressed sequence of sequence *c* of length *n* is a sequence *p* of length *n*, so that *p**i* equals to the number of integers which are less than or equal to *c**i* in the sequence *c*. For example, for the sequence *c*<==<=[250,<=200,<=300,<=100,<=50] the compressed sequence will be *p*<==<=[4,<=3,<=5,<=2,<=1]. Pay attention that in *c* all integers are distinct. Consequently, the compressed sequence contains all integers from 1 to *n* inclusively.\n\nHelp Dasha to find any sequence *b* for which the calculated compressed sequence of sequence *c* is correct.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *l*, *r* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the length of the sequence and boundaries of the segment where the elements of sequences *a* and *b* are.\n\nThe next line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=<=*a*2,<=<=...,<=<=*a**n* (*l*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*r*) \u2014 the elements of the sequence *a*.\n\nThe next line contains *n* distinct integers *p*1,<=<=*p*2,<=<=...,<=<=*p**n* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the compressed sequence of the sequence *c*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf there is no the suitable sequence *b*, then in the only line print \"-1\".\n\nOtherwise, in the only line print *n* integers \u2014 the elements of any suitable sequence *b*.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 1 5\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n3 1 5 4 2\\n', '4 2 9\\n3 4 8 9\\n3 2 1 4\\n', '6 1 5\\n1 1 1 1 1 1\\n2 3 5 4 1 6\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3 1 5 4 2 ', '2 2 2 9 ', '-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nSequence *b* which was found in the second sample is suitable, because calculated sequence *c*\u2009=\u2009[2\u2009-\u20093,\u20092\u2009-\u20094,\u20092\u2009-\u20098,\u20099\u2009-\u20099]\u2009=\u2009[\u2009-\u20091,\u2009\u2009-\u20092,\u2009\u2009-\u20096,\u20090] (note that *c*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub>\u2009=\u2009*b*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub>\u2009-\u2009*a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub>) has compressed sequence equals to *p*\u2009=\u2009[3,\u20092,\u20091,\u20094].",

All points have non-negative integer coordinates. Moreover, if some point (*x*, *y*) belongs to the set, then all points (*x*', *y*'), such that 0<=\u2264<=*x*'<=\u2264<=*x* and 0<=\u2264<=*y*'<=\u2264<=*y* also belong to this set.\n\nNow Wilbur wants to number the points in the set he has, that is assign them distinct integer numbers from 1 to *n*. In order to make the numbering aesthetically pleasing, Wilbur imposes the condition that if some point (*x*, *y*) gets number *i*, then all (*x*',*y*') from the set, such that *x*'<=\u2265<=*x* and *y*'<=\u2265<=*y* must be assigned a number not less than *i*. For example, for a set of four points (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) and (1, 1), there are two aesthetically pleasing numberings. One is 1, 2, 3, 4 and another one is 1, 3, 2, 4.\n\nWilbur's friend comes along and challenges Wilbur. For any point he defines it's special value as *s*(*x*,<=*y*)<==<=*y*<=-<=*x*. Now he gives Wilbur some *w*1, *w*2,..., *w**n*, and asks him to find an aesthetically pleasing numbering of the points in the set, such that the point that gets number *i* has it's special value equal to *w**i*, that is *s*(*x**i*,<=*y**i*)<==<=*y**i*<=-<=*x**i*<==<=*w**i*.\n\nNow Wilbur asks you to help him with this challenge.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input consists of a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of points in the set Wilbur is playing with.\n\nNext follow *n* lines with points descriptions. Each line contains two integers *x* and *y* (0<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=\u2264<=100<=000), that give one point in Wilbur's set. It's guaranteed that all points are distinct. Also, it is guaranteed that if some point (*x*, *y*) is present in the input, then all points (*x*', *y*'), such that 0<=\u2264<=*x*'<=\u2264<=*x* and 0<=\u2264<=*y*'<=\u2264<=*y*, are also present in the input.\n\nThe last line of the input contains *n* integers. The *i*-th of them is *w**i* (<=-<=100<=000<=\u2264<=*w**i*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the required special value of the point that gets number *i* in any aesthetically pleasing numbering.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf there exists an aesthetically pleasant numbering of points in the set, such that *s*(*x**i*,<=*y**i*)<==<=*y**i*<=-<=*x**i*<==<=*w**i*, then print \"YES\" on the first line of the output. Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nIf a solution exists, proceed output with *n* lines. On the *i*-th of these lines print the point of the set that gets number *i*. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5\\n2 0\\n0 0\\n1 0\\n1 1\\n0 1\\n0 -1 -2 1 0\\n', '3\\n1 0\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n0 1 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n0 0\\n1 0\\n2 0\\n0 1\\n1 1\\n', 'NO\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, point (2, 0) gets number 3, point (0, 0) gets number one, point (1, 0) gets number 2, point (1, 1) gets number 5 and point (0, 1) gets number 4. One can easily check that this numbering is aesthetically pleasing and *y*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub>\u2009-\u2009*x*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub>\u2009=\u2009*w*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub>.\n\nIn the second sample, the special values of the points in the set are 0, \u2009-\u20091, and \u2009-\u20092 while the sequence that the friend gives to Wilbur is 0, 1, 2.

All *w**i*'s are distinct, they follow in the strictly increasing order.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf it is possible to make at least *r* candles burn during each visit, then print the minimum number of candles that Anya needs to light for that.\n\nIf that is impossible, print <=-<=1.\n\nDemo Input:\n['1 8 3\\n10\\n', '2 10 1\\n5 8\\n', '1 1 3\\n10\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n', '1\\n', '-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nAnya can start lighting a candle in the same second with ghost visit. But this candle isn't counted as burning at this visit.\n\nIt takes exactly one second to light up a candle and only after that second this candle is considered burning; it means that if Anya starts lighting candle at moment x, candle is buring from second x + 1 to second x + t inclusively.\n\nIn the first sample test three candles are enough. For example, Anya can start lighting them at the 3-rd, 5-th and 7-th seconds after the midnight.\n\nIn the second sample test one candle is enough. For example, Anya can start lighting it one second before the midnight.\n\nIn the third sample test the answer is \u2009-\u20091, since during each second at most one candle can burn but Anya needs three candles to light up the room at the moment when the ghost comes.",

Horrible! \n\nAside from loving sweet things, thieves from this area are known to be very greedy. So after a thief takes his number of chocolates for himself, the next thief will take exactly *k* times more than the previous one. The value of *k* (*k*<=&gt;<=1) is a secret integer known only to them. It is also known that each thief's bag can carry at most *n* chocolates (if they intend to take more, the deal is cancelled) and that there were exactly four thieves involved. \n\nSadly, only the thieves know the value of *n*, but rumours say that the numbers of ways they could have taken the chocolates (for a fixed *n*, but not fixed *k*) is *m*. Two ways are considered different if one of the thieves (they should be numbered in the order they take chocolates) took different number of chocolates in them.\n\nMike want to track the thieves down, so he wants to know what their bags are and value of *n* will help him in that. Please find the smallest possible value of *n* or tell him that the rumors are false and there is no such *n*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe single line of input contains the integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=1015)\u00a0\u2014 the number of ways the thieves might steal the chocolates, as rumours say.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the only integer *n*\u00a0\u2014 the maximum amount of chocolates that thieves' bags can carry. If there are more than one *n* satisfying the rumors, print the smallest one.\n\nIf there is no such *n* for a false-rumoured *m*, print <=-<=1.\n\nDemo Input:\n['1\\n', '8\\n', '10\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['8\\n', '54\\n', '-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample case the smallest *n* that leads to exactly one way of stealing chocolates is *n*\u2009=\u20098, whereas the amounts of stealed chocolates are (1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20098) (the number of chocolates stolen by each of the thieves).\n\nIn the second sample case the smallest *n* that leads to exactly 8 ways is *n*\u2009=\u200954 with the possibilities: (1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20098),\u2009\u2002(1,\u20093,\u20099,\u200927),\u2009\u2002(2,\u20094,\u20098,\u200916),\u2009\u2002(2,\u20096,\u200918,\u200954),\u2009\u2002(3,\u20096,\u200912,\u200924),\u2009\u2002(4,\u20098,\u200916,\u200932),\u2009\u2002(5,\u200910,\u200920,\u200940),\u2009\u2002(6,\u200912,\u200924,\u200948).\n\nThere is no *n* leading to exactly 10 ways of stealing chocolates in the third sample case.",

        "prompt": "Title: Plus and Square Root\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nZS the Coder is playing a game. There is a number displayed on the screen and there are two buttons, '<=+<=' (plus) and '' (square root). Initially, the number 2 is displayed on the screen. There are *n*<=+<=1 levels in the game and ZS the Coder start at the level 1.\n\nWhen ZS the Coder is at level *k*, he can :\n 1.  Press the '<=+<=' button. This increases the number on the screen by exactly *k*. So, if the number on the screen was *x*, it becomes *x*<=+<=*k*.1.  Press the '' button. Let the number on the screen be *x*. After pressing this button, the number becomes . After that, ZS the Coder levels up, so his current level becomes *k*<=+<=1. This button can only be pressed when *x* is a perfect square, i.e. *x*<==<=*m*2 for some positive integer *m*. \nAdditionally, after each move, if ZS the Coder is at level *k*, and the number on the screen is *m*, then *m* must be a multiple of *k*. Note that this condition is only checked after performing the press. For example, if ZS the Coder is at level 4 and current number is 100, he presses the '' button and the number turns into 10. Note that at this moment, 10 is not divisible by 4, but this press is still valid, because after it, ZS the Coder is at level 5, and 10 is divisible by 5.\n\nZS the Coder needs your help in beating the game\u00a0\u2014 he wants to reach level *n*<=+<=1. In other words, he needs to press the '' button *n* times. Help him determine the number of times he should press the '<=+<=' button before pressing the '' button at each level. \n\nPlease note that ZS the Coder wants to find just any sequence of presses allowing him to reach level *n*<=+<=1, but not necessarily a sequence minimizing the number of presses.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first and only line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000), denoting that ZS the Coder wants to reach level *n*<=+<=1.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *n* non-negative integers, one per line. *i*-th of them should be equal to the number of times that ZS the Coder needs to press the '<=+<=' button before pressing the '' button at level *i*. \n\nEach number in the output should not exceed 1018.

        "prompt": "Title: Testing Robots\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe Cybernetics Failures (CF) organisation made a prototype of a bomb technician robot. To find the possible problems it was decided to carry out a series of tests. At the beginning of each test the robot prototype will be placed in cell (*x*0,<=*y*0) of a rectangular squared field of size *x*<=\u00d7<=*y*, after that a mine will be installed into one of the squares of the field. It is supposed to conduct exactly *x*\u00b7*y* tests, each time a mine is installed into a square that has never been used before. The starting cell of the robot always remains the same.\n\nAfter placing the objects on the field the robot will have to run a sequence of commands given by string *s*, consisting only of characters 'L', 'R', 'U', 'D'. These commands tell the robot to move one square to the left, to the right, up or down, or stay idle if moving in the given direction is impossible. As soon as the robot fulfills all the sequence of commands, it will blow up due to a bug in the code. But if at some moment of time the robot is at the same square with the mine, it will also blow up, but not due to a bug in the code.\n\nMoving to the left decreases coordinate *y*, and moving to the right increases it. Similarly, moving up decreases the *x* coordinate, and moving down increases it.\n\nThe tests can go on for very long, so your task is to predict their results. For each *k* from 0 to *length*(*s*) your task is to find in how many tests the robot will run exactly *k* commands before it blows up.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains four integers *x*, *y*, *x*0, *y*0 (1<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=\u2264<=500,<=1<=\u2264<=*x*0<=\u2264<=*x*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*0<=\u2264<=*y*)\u00a0\u2014 the sizes of the field and the starting coordinates of the robot. The coordinate axis *X* is directed downwards and axis *Y* is directed to the right.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of commands *s*, which should be fulfilled by the robot. It has length from 1 to 100<=000 characters and only consists of characters 'L', 'R', 'U', 'D'.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the sequence consisting of (*length*(*s*)<=+<=1) numbers. On the *k*-th position, starting with zero, print the number of tests where the robot will run exactly *k* commands before it blows up.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 4 2 2\\nUURDRDRL\\n', '2 2 2 2\\nULD\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 6\\n', '1 1 1 1\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, if we exclude the probable impact of the mines, the robot's route will look like that: <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/16bfda1e4f41cc00665c31f0a1d754d68cd9b4ab.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.",

        "prompt": "Title: Martian Clock\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nHaving stayed home alone, Petya decided to watch forbidden films on the Net in secret. \"What ungentlemanly behavior!\" \u2014 you can say that, of course, but don't be too harsh on the kid. In his country films about the Martians and other extraterrestrial civilizations are forbidden. It was very unfair to Petya as he adored adventure stories that featured lasers and robots. \n\nToday Petya is watching a shocking blockbuster about the Martians called \"R2:D2\". What can \"R2:D2\" possibly mean? It might be the Martian time represented in the Martian numeral system. Petya knows that time on Mars is counted just like on the Earth (that is, there are 24 hours and each hour has 60 minutes). The time is written as \"*a*:*b*\", where the string *a* stands for the number of hours (from 0 to 23 inclusive), and string *b* stands for the number of minutes (from 0 to 59 inclusive). The only thing Petya doesn't know is in what numeral system the Martian time is written.\n\nYour task is to print the radixes of all numeral system which can contain the time \"*a*:*b*\".\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single string as \"*a*:*b*\" (without the quotes). There *a* is a non-empty string, consisting of numbers and uppercase Latin letters. String *a* shows the number of hours. String *b* is a non-empty string that consists of numbers and uppercase Latin letters. String *b* shows the number of minutes. The lengths of strings *a* and *b* are from 1 to 5 characters, inclusive. Please note that strings *a* and *b* can have leading zeroes that do not influence the result in any way (for example, string \"008:1\" in decimal notation denotes correctly written time).\n\nWe consider characters 0, 1, ..., 9 as denoting the corresponding digits of the number's representation in some numeral system, and characters A, B, ..., Z correspond to numbers 10, 11, ..., 35.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the radixes of the numeral systems that can represent the time \"*a*:*b*\" in the increasing order. Separate the numbers with spaces or line breaks. If there is no numeral system that can represent time \"*a*:*b*\", print the single integer 0. If there are infinitely many numeral systems that can represent the time \"*a*:*b*\", print the single integer -1.\n\nNote that on Mars any positional numeral systems with positive radix strictly larger than one are possible.\n\nDemo Input:\n['11:20\\n', '2A:13\\n', '000B:00001\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22', '0\\n', '-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nLet's consider the first sample. String \"11:20\" can be perceived, for example, as time 4:6, represented in the ternary numeral system or as time 17:32 in hexadecimal system. \n\nLet's consider the second sample test. String \"2A:13\" can't be perceived as correct time in any notation. For example, let's take the base-11 numeral notation. There the given string represents time 32:14 that isn't a correct time.\n\nLet's consider the third sample. String \"000B:00001\" can be perceived as a correct time in the infinite number of numeral systems. If you need an example, you can take any numeral system with radix no less than 12.",

        "prompt": "Title: Rectangle and Square\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nLittle Petya very much likes rectangles and especially squares. Recently he has received 8 points on the plane as a gift from his mother. The points are pairwise distinct. Petya decided to split them into two sets each containing 4 points so that the points from the first set lay at the vertexes of some square and the points from the second set lay at the vertexes of a rectangle. Each point of initial 8 should belong to exactly one set. It is acceptable for a rectangle from the second set was also a square. If there are several partitions, Petya will be satisfied by any of them. Help him find such partition. Note that the rectangle and the square from the partition should have non-zero areas. The sides of the figures do not have to be parallel to the coordinate axes, though it might be the case.\n\nInput Specification:\nYou are given 8 pairs of integers, a pair per line \u2014 the coordinates of the points Petya has. The absolute value of all coordinates does not exceed 104. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint in the first output line \"YES\" (without the quotes), if the desired partition exists. In the second line output 4 space-separated numbers \u2014 point indexes from the input, which lie at the vertexes of the square. The points are numbered starting from 1. The numbers can be printed in any order. In the third line print the indexes of points lying at the vertexes of a rectangle in the similar format. All printed numbers should be pairwise distinct.\n\nIf the required partition does not exist, the first line should contain the word \"NO\" (without the quotes), after which no output is needed.\n\nDemo Input:\n['0 0\\n10 11\\n10 0\\n0 11\\n1 1\\n2 2\\n2 1\\n1 2\\n', '0 0\\n1 1\\n2 2\\n3 3\\n4 4\\n5 5\\n6 6\\n7 7\\n', '0 0\\n4 4\\n4 0\\n0 4\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 2\\n2 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n5 6 7 8\\n1 2 3 4\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n1 2 3 4\\n5 6 7 8\\n']\n\nNote:\nPay attention to the third example: the figures do not necessarily have to be parallel to the coordinate axes.",

A program in this language always takes one non-negative integer and returns one non-negative integer as well.\n\nIn the language, there are only three commands: apply a bitwise operation AND, OR or XOR with a given constant to the current integer. A program can contain an arbitrary sequence of these operations with arbitrary constants from 0 to 1023. When the program is run, all operations are applied (in the given order) to the argument and in the end the result integer is returned.\n\nPetya wrote a program in this language, but it turned out to be too long. Write a program in CALPAS that does the same thing as the Petya's program, and consists of no more than 5 lines. Your program should return the same integer as Petya's program for all arguments from 0 to 1023.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of lines.\n\nNext *n* lines contain commands.

That's why he decided to make himself a new one following a certain algorithm.\n\nSereja takes a blank piece of paper. Then he starts writing out the sequence in *m* stages. Each time he either adds a new number to the end of the sequence or takes *l* first elements of the current sequence and adds them *c* times to the end. More formally, if we represent the current sequence as *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, then after we apply the described operation, the sequence transforms into *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*[,<=*a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**l*] (the block in the square brackets must be repeated *c* times). \n\nA day has passed and Sereja has completed the sequence. He wonders what are the values of some of its elements. Help Sereja.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of stages to build a sequence. \n\nNext *m* lines contain the description of the stages in the order they follow. The first number in the line is a type of stage (1 or 2). Type 1 means adding one number to the end of the sequence, in this case the line contains integer *x**i* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number to add. Type 2 means copying a prefix of length *l**i* to the end *c**i* times, in this case the line further contains two integers *l**i*,<=*c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=105,<=1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=104), *l**i* is the length of the prefix, *c**i* is the number of copyings. It is guaranteed that the length of prefix *l**i* is never larger than the current length of the sequence.\n\nThe next line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements Sereja is interested in. The next line contains the numbers of elements of the final sequence Sereja is interested in. The numbers are given in the strictly increasing order. It is guaranteed that all numbers are strictly larger than zero and do not exceed the length of the resulting sequence. Consider the elements of the final sequence numbered starting from 1 from the beginning to the end of the sequence.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the elements that Sereja is interested in, in the order in which their numbers occur in the input.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6\\n1 1\\n1 2\\n2 2 1\\n1 3\\n2 5 2\\n1 4\\n16\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1 2 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 4\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

All he's got to do now is to hire the staff.\n\nThe store will work seven days a week, but not around the clock. Every day at least *k* people must work in the store.\n\nBerland has a law that determines the order of working days and non-working days. Namely, each employee must work for exactly *n* consecutive days, then rest for exactly *m* days, then work for *n* more days and rest for *m* more, and so on. Vitaly doesn't want to break the law. Fortunately, there is a loophole: the law comes into force on the day when the employee is hired. For example, if an employee is hired on day *x*, then he should work on days [*x*,<=*x*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*x*<=+<=*n*<=-<=1], [*x*<=+<=*m*<=+<=*n*,<=*x*<=+<=*m*<=+<=*n*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*x*<=+<=*m*<=+<=2*n*<=-<=1], and so on. Day *x* can be chosen arbitrarily by Vitaly.\n\nThere is one more thing: the key to the store. Berland law prohibits making copies of keys, so there is only one key. Vitaly is planning to entrust the key to the store employees. At the same time on each day the key must be with an employee who works that day \u2014 otherwise on this day no one can get inside the store. During the day the key holder can give the key to another employee, if he also works that day. The key will handed to the first hired employee at his first working day.\n\nEach employee has to be paid salary. Therefore, Vitaly wants to hire as few employees as possible provided that the store can operate normally on each day from 1 to infinity. In other words, on each day with index from 1 to infinity, the store must have at least *k* working employees, and one of the working employees should have the key to the store.\n\nHelp Vitaly and determine the minimum required number of employees, as well as days on which they should be hired.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *m* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000, *n*<=\u2260<=1, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=1000).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print a single integer *z* \u2014 the minimum required number of employees.\n\nIn the second line print *z* positive integers, separated by spaces: the *i*-th integer *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=104) should represent the number of the day, on which Vitaly should hire the *i*-th employee.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 3 2\\n', '3 3 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4\\n1 1 4 5', '3\\n1 3 5']\n\nNote:\nnone",

The armies of flatlanders stand on the borders of circles, the circles' centers are in the surrounded cities. At any moment all points of the flatland ring can begin to move quickly in the direction of the city \u2014 that's the strategy the flatlanders usually follow when they besiege cities.\n\nThe berlanders are sure that they can repel the enemy's attack if they learn the exact time the attack starts. For that they need to construct a radar that would register any movement at the distance of at most *r* from it. Thus, we can install a radar at such point, that at least one point of the enemy ring will be in its detecting range (that is, at a distance of at most *r*). Then the radar can immediately inform about the enemy's attack. \n\nDue to the newest technologies, we can place a radar at any point without any problems. But the problem is that the berlanders have the time to make only one radar. Besides, the larger the detection radius (*r*) is, the more the radar costs.\n\nThat's why Vasya's task (that is, your task) is to find the minimum possible detection radius for the radar. In other words, your task is to find the minimum radius *r* (*r*<=\u2265<=0) such, that a radar with radius *r* can be installed at some point and it can register the start of the movements of both flatland rings from that point. \n\nIn this problem you can consider the cities as material points, the attacking enemy rings - as circles with centers in the cities, the radar's detection range \u2014 as a disk (including the border) with the center at the point where the radar is placed.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input files consist of two lines. Each line represents the city and the flatland ring that surrounds it as three space-separated integers *x**i*, *y**i*, *r**i* (|*x**i*|,<=|*y**i*|<=\u2264<=104;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the city's coordinates and the distance from the city to the flatlanders, correspondingly.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the cities are located at different points.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single real number \u2014 the minimum detection radius of the described radar.

In this sample the best decision is to put the radar at point with coordinates (2,\u20090). \n\nThe figure below shows the answer for the second sample.

However as the ship was about to moor, the captain found out that some rat ate a piece of the treasure map.\n\nThe treasure map can be represented as a rectangle *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* in size. Each cell stands for an islands' square (the square's side length equals to a mile). Some cells stand for the sea and they are impenetrable. All other cells are penetrable (i.e. available) and some of them contain local sights. For example, the large tree on the hills or the cave in the rocks.\n\nBesides, the map also has a set of *k* instructions. Each instruction is in the following form:\n\n\"Walk *n* miles in the *y* direction\"\n\nThe possible directions are: north, south, east, and west. If you follow these instructions carefully (you should fulfill all of them, one by one) then you should reach exactly the place where treasures are buried. \n\nUnfortunately the captain doesn't know the place where to start fulfilling the instructions \u2014 as that very piece of the map was lost. But the captain very well remembers that the place contained some local sight. Besides, the captain knows that the whole way goes through the island's penetrable squares.\n\nThe captain wants to know which sights are worth checking. He asks you to help him with that.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (3<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000).\n\nThen follow *n* lines containing *m* integers each \u2014 the island map's description. \"#\" stands for the sea. It is guaranteed that all cells along the rectangle's perimeter are the sea. \".\" stands for a penetrable square without any sights and the sights are marked with uppercase Latin letters from \"A\" to \"Z\". Not all alphabet letters can be used. However, it is guaranteed that at least one of them is present on the map. All local sights are marked by different letters.\n\nThe next line contains number *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=105), after which *k* lines follow. Each line describes an instruction. Each instruction possesses the form \"*dir* *len*\", where *dir* stands for the direction and *len* stands for the length of the way to walk. *dir* can take values \"N\", \"S\", \"W\" and \"E\" for North, South, West and East correspondingly. At that, north is to the top, South is to the bottom, west is to the left and east is to the right. *len* is an integer from 1 to 1000.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint all local sights that satisfy to the instructions as a string without any separators in the alphabetical order.

Each tile has an English letter written in it. The letters don't have to be unique: there might be two or more tiles with the same letter written on them. Here is an example of a grid:\n\nWe say that two tiles are adjacent if they share a side or a corner. In the example grid above, the tile with the letter 'A' is adjacent only to the tiles with letters 'B', 'N', and 'O'. A tile is not adjacent to itself.\n\nA sequence of tiles is called a path if each tile in the sequence is adjacent to the tile which follows it (except for the last tile in the sequence, which of course has no successor). In this example, \"ABC\" is a path, and so is \"KXWIHIJK\". \"MAB\" is not a path because 'M' is not adjacent to 'A'. A single tile can be used more than once by a path (though the tile cannot occupy two consecutive places in the path because no tile is adjacent to itself).\n\nYou\u2019re given a string *s* which consists of 27 upper-case English letters.

He drove *n* nails and numbered them from 1 to *n* in some order. Bender decided to make a picture using metal rods. The picture is a closed polyline, which vertices should be nails (in the given order). The segments of the polyline should be parallel to the coordinate axes. Polyline is allowed to have self-intersections. Bender can take a rod and fold it exactly once in any place to form an angle of 90 degrees. Then he can attach the place of the fold to some unoccupied nail and attach two ends of this rod to adjacent nails. A nail is considered unoccupied if there is no rod attached to it (neither by it's end nor the by the fold place). No rod could be used twice. It is not required to use all the rods.\n\nHelp Bender to solve this difficult task.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two positive integers *n* and *m* (4<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=500,<=2<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=500, *n* is even) \u2014 the amount of nails and the amount of rods. *i*-th of the following *n* lines contains a pair of integers, denoting the coordinates of the *i*-th nail. Nails should be connected in the same order as they are given in the input. The last line contains *m* integers \u2014 the lenghts of the rods. All coordinates do not exceed 104 by absolute value. Lengths of the rods are between 1 and 200<=000. No rod can be used twice. It is guaranteed that all segments of the given polyline are parallel to coordinate axes. No three consecutive nails lie on the same line.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf it is impossible to solve Bender's problem, output NO. Otherwise, output YES in the first line, and in the second line output *n* numbers \u2014 *i*-th of them should be the number of rod, which fold place is attached to the *i*-th nail, or -1, if there is no such rod.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 2\\n0 0\\n0 2\\n2 2\\n2 0\\n4 4\\n', '6 3\\n0 0\\n1 0\\n1 1\\n2 1\\n2 2\\n0 2\\n3 2 3\\n', '6 3\\n0 0\\n1 0\\n1 1\\n2 1\\n2 2\\n0 2\\n2 2 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n1 -1 2 -1 \\n', 'YES\\n1 -1 2 -1 3 -1 \\n', 'NO\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Jerry's Protest\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nAndrew and Jerry are playing a game with Harry as the scorekeeper. The game consists of three rounds. In each round, Andrew and Jerry draw randomly without replacement from a jar containing *n* balls, each labeled with a distinct positive integer. Without looking, they hand their balls to Harry, who awards the point to the player with the larger number and returns the balls to the jar. The winner of the game is the one who wins at least two of the three rounds.\n\nAndrew wins rounds 1 and 2 while Jerry wins round 3, so Andrew wins the game. However, Jerry is unhappy with this system, claiming that he will often lose the match despite having the higher overall total. What is the probability that the sum of the three balls Jerry drew is strictly higher than the sum of the three balls Andrew drew?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000) \u2014 the number of balls in the jar.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=5000) \u2014 the number written on the *i*th ball. It is guaranteed that no two balls have the same number.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single real value \u2014 the probability that Jerry has a higher total, given that Andrew wins the first two rounds and Jerry wins the third. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10<=-<=6. \n\nNamely: let's assume that your answer is *a*, and the answer of the jury is *b*. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if .\n\nDemo Input:\n['2\\n1 2\\n', '3\\n1 2 10\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0.0000000000\\n', '0.0740740741\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first case, there are only two balls. In the first two rounds, Andrew must have drawn the 2 and Jerry must have drawn the 1, and vice versa in the final round. Thus, Andrew's sum is 5 and Jerry's sum is 4, so Jerry never has a higher total.\n\nIn the second case, each game could've had three outcomes \u2014 10\u2009-\u20092, 10\u2009-\u20091, or 2\u2009-\u20091. Jerry has a higher total if and only if Andrew won 2\u2009-\u20091 in both of the first two rounds, and Jerry drew the 10 in the last round.

        "prompt": "Title: Travel Cards\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIn the evening Polycarp decided to analyze his today's travel expenses on public transport.\n\nThe bus system in the capital of Berland is arranged in such a way that each bus runs along the route between two stops. Each bus has no intermediate stops. So each of the buses continuously runs along the route from one stop to the other and back. There is at most one bus running between a pair of stops.\n\nPolycarp made *n* trips on buses. About each trip the stop where he started the trip and the the stop where he finished are known. The trips follow in the chronological order in Polycarp's notes.\n\nIt is known that one trip on any bus costs *a* burles. In case when passenger makes a transshipment the cost of trip decreases to *b* burles (*b*<=&lt;<=*a*). A passenger makes a transshipment if the stop on which he boards the bus coincides with the stop where he left the previous bus. Obviously, the first trip can not be made with transshipment.\n\nFor example, if Polycarp made three consecutive trips: \"BerBank\"  \"University\", \"University\"  \"BerMall\", \"University\"  \"BerBank\", then he payed *a*<=+<=*b*<=+<=*a*<==<=2*a*<=+<=*b* burles. From the BerBank he arrived to the University, where he made transshipment to the other bus and departed to the BerMall. Then he walked to the University and returned to the BerBank by bus.\n\nAlso Polycarp can buy no more than *k* travel cards. Each travel card costs *f* burles. The travel card for a single bus route makes free of charge any trip by this route (in both directions). Once purchased, a travel card can be used any number of times in any direction.\n\nWhat is the smallest amount of money Polycarp could have spent today if he can buy no more than *k* travel cards?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains five integers *n*,<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*k*,<=*f* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=300, 1<=\u2264<=*b*<=&lt;<=*a*<=\u2264<=100, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=300, 1<=\u2264<=*f*<=\u2264<=1000) where:\n -  *n* \u2014 the number of Polycarp trips, -  *a* \u2014 the cost of a regualar single trip, -  *b* \u2014 the cost of a trip after a transshipment, -  *k* \u2014 the maximum number of travel cards Polycarp can buy, -  *f* \u2014 the cost of a single travel card. \nThe following *n* lines describe the trips in the chronological order. Each line contains exactly two different words separated by a single space \u2014 the name of the start stop and the name of the finish stop of the trip. All names consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters and have lengths between 1 to 20 letters inclusive. Uppercase and lowercase letters should be considered different.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the smallest amount of money Polycarp could have spent today, if he can purchase no more than *k* travel cards.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 5 3 1 8\\nBerBank University\\nUniversity BerMall\\nUniversity BerBank\\n', '4 2 1 300 1000\\na A\\nA aa\\naa AA\\nAA a\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['11\\n', '5\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example Polycarp can buy travel card for the route \"BerBank <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/ecc94b07e73defe233bfe831f3977337706a2d27.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> University\" and spend 8 burles. Note that his second trip \"University\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"BerMall\" was made after transshipment, so for this trip Polycarp payed 3 burles. So the minimum total sum equals to 8\u2009+\u20093\u2009=\u200911 burles.\n\nIn the second example it doesn't make sense to buy travel cards. Note that each of Polycarp trip (except the first) was made with transshipment. So the minimum total sum equals to 2\u2009+\u20091\u2009+\u20091\u2009+\u20091\u2009=\u20095 burles.",

        "prompt": "Title: Playing with Permutations\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nLittle Petya likes permutations a lot. Recently his mom has presented him permutation *q*1,<=*q*2,<=...,<=*q**n* of length *n*.\n\nA permutation *a* of length *n* is a sequence of integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*), all integers there are distinct. \n\nThere is only one thing Petya likes more than permutations: playing with little Masha. As it turns out, Masha also has a permutation of length *n*. Petya decided to get the same permutation, whatever the cost may be. For that, he devised a game with the following rules:\n -  Before the beginning of the game Petya writes permutation 1,<=2,<=...,<=*n* on the blackboard. After that Petya makes exactly *k* moves, which are described below. -  During a move Petya tosses a coin. If the coin shows heads, he performs point 1, if the coin shows tails, he performs point 2.  Let's assume that the board contains permutation *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* at the given moment. Then Petya removes the written permutation *p* from the board and writes another one instead: *p**q*1,<=*p**q*2,<=...,<=*p**q**n*. In other words, Petya applies permutation *q* (which he has got from his mother) to permutation *p*. -  All actions are similar to point 1, except that Petya writes permutation *t* on the board, such that: *t**q**i*<==<=*p**i* for all *i* from 1 to *n*. In other words, Petya applies a permutation that is inverse to *q* to permutation *p*. \nWe know that after the *k*-th move the board contained Masha's permutation *s*1,<=*s*2,<=...,<=*s**n*. Besides, we know that throughout the game process Masha's permutation never occurred on the board before the *k*-th move. Note that the game has exactly *k* moves, that is, throughout the game the coin was tossed exactly *k* times.\n\nYour task is to determine whether the described situation is possible or else state that Petya was mistaken somewhere. See samples and notes to them for a better understanding.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=100). The second line contains *n* space-separated integers *q*1,<=*q*2,<=...,<=*q**n* (1<=\u2264<=*q**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the permutation that Petya's got as a present. The third line contains Masha's permutation *s*, in the similar format.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given sequences *q* and *s* are correct permutations.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf the situation that is described in the statement is possible, print \"YES\" (without the quotes), otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 1\\n2 3 4 1\\n1 2 3 4\\n', '4 1\\n4 3 1 2\\n3 4 2 1\\n', '4 3\\n4 3 1 2\\n3 4 2 1\\n', '4 2\\n4 3 1 2\\n2 1 4 3\\n', '4 1\\n4 3 1 2\\n2 1 4 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['NO\\n', 'YES\\n', 'YES\\n', 'YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample Masha's permutation coincides with the permutation that was written on the board before the beginning of the game.

        "prompt": "Title: Three-dimensional Turtle Super Computer \n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nA super computer has been built in the Turtle Academy of Sciences. The computer consists of *n*\u00b7*m*\u00b7*k* CPUs. The architecture was the paralellepiped of size *n*<=\u00d7<=*m*<=\u00d7<=*k*, split into 1<=\u00d7<=1<=\u00d7<=1 cells, each cell contains exactly one CPU. Thus, each CPU can be simultaneously identified as a group of three numbers from the layer number from 1 to *n*, the line number from 1 to *m* and the column number from 1 to *k*.\n\nIn the process of the Super Computer's work the CPUs can send each other messages by the famous turtle scheme: CPU (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*) can send messages to CPUs (*x*<=+<=1,<=*y*,<=*z*), (*x*,<=*y*<=+<=1,<=*z*) and (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*<=+<=1) (of course, if they exist), there is no feedback, that is, CPUs (*x*<=+<=1,<=*y*,<=*z*), (*x*,<=*y*<=+<=1,<=*z*) and (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*<=+<=1) cannot send messages to CPU (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*).\n\nOver time some CPUs broke down and stopped working. Such CPUs cannot send messages, receive messages or serve as intermediates in transmitting messages. We will say that CPU (*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*) controls CPU (*d*,<=*e*,<=*f*) , if there is a chain of CPUs (*x**i*,<=*y**i*,<=*z**i*), such that (*x*1<==<=*a*,<=*y*1<==<=*b*,<=*z*1<==<=*c*), (*x**p*<==<=*d*,<=*y**p*<==<=*e*,<=*z**p*<==<=*f*) (here and below *p* is the length of the chain) and the CPU in the chain with number *i* (*i*<=&lt;<=*p*) can send messages to CPU *i*<=+<=1.\n\nTurtles are quite concerned about the denial-proofness of the system of communication between the remaining CPUs. For that they want to know the number of critical CPUs. A CPU (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*) is critical, if turning it off will disrupt some control, that is, if there are two distinctive from (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*) CPUs: (*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*) and (*d*,<=*e*,<=*f*), such that (*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*) controls (*d*,<=*e*,<=*f*) before (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*) is turned off and stopped controlling it after the turning off.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *m* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the dimensions of the Super Computer. \n\nThen *n* blocks follow, describing the current state of the processes. The blocks correspond to the layers of the Super Computer in the order from 1 to *n*. Each block consists of *m* lines, *k* characters in each \u2014 the description of a layer in the format of an *m*<=\u00d7<=*k* table. Thus, the state of the CPU (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*) is corresponded to the *z*-th character of the *y*-th line of the block number *x*. Character \"1\" corresponds to a working CPU and character \"0\" corresponds to a malfunctioning one. The blocks are separated by exactly one empty line.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of critical CPUs, that is, such that turning only this CPU off will disrupt some control.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 2 3\\n000\\n000\\n\\n111\\n111\\n', '3 3 3\\n111\\n111\\n111\\n\\n111\\n111\\n111\\n\\n111\\n111\\n111\\n', '1 1 10\\n0101010101\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '19\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample the whole first layer of CPUs is malfunctional. In the second layer when CPU (2,\u20091,\u20092) turns off, it disrupts the control by CPU (2,\u20091,\u20093) over CPU (2,\u20091,\u20091), and when CPU (2,\u20092,\u20092) is turned off, it disrupts the control over CPU (2,\u20092,\u20093) by CPU (2,\u20092,\u20091).\n\nIn the second sample all processors except for the corner ones are critical.\n\nIn the third sample there is not a single processor controlling another processor, so the answer is 0.",

        "prompt": "Title: Hockey\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nPetya loves hockey very much. One day, as he was watching a hockey match, he fell asleep. Petya dreamt of being appointed to change a hockey team's name. Thus, Petya was given the original team name *w* and the collection of forbidden substrings *s*1,<=*s*2,<=...,<=*s**n*. All those strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. String *w* has the length of |*w*|, its characters are numbered from 1 to |*w*|.\n\nFirst Petya should find all the occurrences of forbidden substrings in the *w* string. During the search of substrings the case of letter shouldn't be taken into consideration. That is, strings \"aBC\" and \"ABc\" are considered equal.\n\nAfter that Petya should perform the replacement of all letters covered by the occurrences. More formally: a letter in the position *i* should be replaced by any other one if for position *i* in string *w* there exist pair of indices *l*,<=*r* (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=|*w*|) such that substring *w*[*l*\u00a0...\u00a0*r*] is contained in the collection *s*1,<=*s*2,<=...,<=*s**n*, when using case insensitive comparison. During the replacement the letter's case should remain the same. Petya is not allowed to replace the letters that aren't covered by any forbidden substring.\n\nLetter *letter* (uppercase or lowercase) is considered lucky for the hockey players. That's why Petya should perform the changes so that the *letter* occurred in the resulting string as many times as possible. Help Petya to find such resulting string. If there are several such strings, find the one that comes first lexicographically.\n\nNote that the process of replacements is not repeated, it occurs only once. That is, if after Petya's replacements the string started to contain new occurrences of bad substrings, Petya pays no attention to them.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains the only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of forbidden substrings in the collection. Next *n* lines contain these substrings. The next line contains string *w*. All those *n*<=+<=1 lines are non-empty strings consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters whose length does not exceed 100. The last line contains a lowercase letter *letter*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput the only line \u2014 Petya's resulting string with the maximum number of letters *letter*. If there are several answers then output the one that comes first lexicographically.\n\nThe lexicographical comparison is performed by the standard &lt; operator in modern programming languages.

In mathematics, GCD is the greatest common divisor, and it's an easy task to calculate the GCD between two positive integers.\n\nA common divisor for two positive numbers is a number which both numbers are divisible by.\n\nBut your teacher wants to give you a harder task, in this task you have to find the greatest common divisor *d* between two integers *a* and *b* that is in a given range from *low* to *high* (inclusive), i.e. *low*<=\u2264<=*d*<=\u2264<=*high*. It is possible that there is no common divisor in the given range.\n\nYou will be given the two integers *a* and *b*, then *n* queries. Each query is a range from *low* to *high* and you have to answer each query.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *a* and *b*, the two integers as described above (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=109). The second line contains one integer *n*, the number of queries (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=104). Then *n* lines follow, each line contains one query consisting of two integers, *low* and *high* (1<=\u2264<=*low*<=\u2264<=*high*<=\u2264<=109).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *n* lines.

Find whether the two squares intersect.\n\nThe interior of the square is considered to be part of the square, i.e. if one square is completely inside another, they intersect. If the two squares only share one common point, they are also considered to intersect.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input data consists of two lines, one for each square, both containing 4 pairs of integers. Each pair represents coordinates of one vertex of the square. Coordinates within each line are either in clockwise or counterclockwise order.\n\nThe first line contains the coordinates of the square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the second line contains the coordinates of the square at 45 degrees.\n\nAll the values are integer and between $-100$ and $100$.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint \"Yes\" if squares intersect, otherwise print \"No\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\nDemo Input:\n['0 0 6 0 6 6 0 6\\n1 3 3 5 5 3 3 1\\n', '0 0 6 0 6 6 0 6\\n7 3 9 5 11 3 9 1\\n', '6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0\\n7 4 4 7 7 10 10 7\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example the second square lies entirely within the first square, so they do intersect.\n\nIn the second sample squares do not have any points in common.\n\nHere are images corresponding to the samples:",

        "prompt": "Title: Network Mask\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe problem uses a simplified TCP/IP address model, please make sure you've read the statement attentively.\n\nPolycarpus has found a job, he is a system administrator. One day he came across *n* IP addresses. Each IP address is a 32 bit number, represented as a group of four 8-bit numbers (without leading zeroes), separated by dots. For example, the record 0.255.1.123 shows a correct IP address and records 0.256.1.123 and 0.255.1.01 do not. In this problem an arbitrary group of four 8-bit numbers is a correct IP address.\n\nHaving worked as an administrator for some time, Polycarpus learned that if you know the IP address, you can use the subnet mask to get the address of the network that has this IP addess.\n\nThe subnet mask is an IP address that has the following property: if we write this IP address as a 32 bit string, that it is representable as \"11...11000..000\". In other words, the subnet mask first has one or more one bits, and then one or more zero bits (overall there are 32 bits). For example, the IP address 2.0.0.0 is not a correct subnet mask as its 32-bit record looks as 00000010000000000000000000000000.\n\nTo get the network address of the IP address, you need to perform the operation of the bitwise \"and\" of the IP address and the subnet mask. For example, if the subnet mask is 255.192.0.0, and the IP address is 192.168.1.2, then the network address equals 192.128.0.0. In the bitwise \"and\" the result has a bit that equals 1 if and only if both operands have corresponding bits equal to one.\n\nNow Polycarpus wants to find all networks to which his IP addresses belong. Unfortunately, Polycarpus lost subnet mask. Fortunately, Polycarpus remembers that his IP addresses belonged to exactly *k* distinct networks. Help Polycarpus find the subnet mask, such that his IP addresses will belong to exactly *k* distinct networks. If there are several such subnet masks, find the one whose bit record contains the least number of ones. If such subnet mask do not exist, say so.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers, *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of IP addresses and networks. The next *n* lines contain the IP addresses.

This time problem is about random permutation. He decided to generate a random permutation this way: he takes identity permutation of numbers from $1$ to $n$ and then $3n$ times takes a random pair of different elements and swaps them. Alex envies Petr and tries to imitate him in all kind of things. Alex has also come up with a problem about random permutation. He generates a random permutation just like Petr but swaps elements $7n+1$ times instead of $3n$ times. Because it is more random, OK?!\n\nYou somehow get a test from one of these problems and now you want to know from which one.\n\nInput Specification:\nIn the first line of input there is one integer $n$ ($10^{3} \\le n \\le 10^{6}$).\n\nIn the second line there are $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$\u00a0\u2014 the permutation of size $n$ from the test.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all tests except for sample are generated this way: First we choose $n$\u00a0\u2014 the size of the permutation. Then we randomly choose a method to generate a permutation\u00a0\u2014 the one of Petr or the one of Alex. Then we generate a permutation using chosen method.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf the test is generated via Petr's method print \"Petr\" (without quotes).

Each road is defined by the equation *a**i**x*<=+<=*b**i**y*<=+<=*c**i*<==<=0, where *a**i* and *b**i* are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.\n\nYour home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).\n\nDetermine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university.

        "prompt": "Title: Harry Potter and the History of Magic\n\nTime Limit: 1 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe History of Magic is perhaps the most boring subject in the Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry Potter is usually asleep during history lessons, and his magical quill writes the lectures for him. Professor Binns, the history of magic teacher, lectures in such a boring and monotonous voice, that he has a soporific effect even on the quill. That's why the quill often makes mistakes, especially in dates.\n\nSo, at the end of the semester Professor Binns decided to collect the students' parchments with notes and check them. Ron Weasley is in a panic: Harry's notes may contain errors, but at least he has some notes, whereas Ron does not have any. Ronald also has been sleeping during the lectures and his quill had been eaten by his rat Scabbers. Hermione Granger refused to give Ron her notes, because, in her opinion, everyone should learn on their own. Therefore, Ron has no choice but to copy Harry's notes.\n\nDue to the quill's errors Harry's dates are absolutely confused: the years of goblin rebellions and other important events for the wizarding world do not follow in order, and sometimes even dates from the future occur. Now Ron wants to change some of the digits while he copies the notes so that the dates were in the chronological (i.e. non-decreasing) order and so that the notes did not have any dates strictly later than 2011, or strictly before than 1000. To make the resulting sequence as close as possible to the one dictated by Professor Binns, Ron will change no more than one digit in each date into other digit. Help him do it.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000). It represents the number of dates in Harry's notes. Next *n* lines contain the actual dates *y*1, *y*2, ..., *y**n*, each line contains a date. Each date is a four-digit integer (1000<=\u2264<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=9999).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *n* numbers *z*1, *z*2, ..., *z**n* (1000<=\u2264<=*z**i*<=\u2264<=2011). They are Ron's resulting dates. Print each number on a single line. Numbers *z**i* must form the non-decreasing sequence. Each number *z**i* should differ from the corresponding date *y**i* in no more than one digit. It is not allowed to change the first digit of a number into 0. If there are several possible solutions, print any of them. If there's no solution, print \"No solution\" (without the quotes).\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n1875\\n1936\\n1721\\n', '4\\n9999\\n2000\\n3000\\n3011\\n', '3\\n1999\\n5055\\n2000\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1835\\n1836\\n1921\\n', '1999\\n2000\\n2000\\n2011\\n', 'No solution\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Mail Stamps\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOne day Bob got a letter in an envelope. Bob knows that when Berland's post officers send a letter directly from city \u00abA\u00bb to city \u00abB\u00bb, they stamp it with \u00abA B\u00bb, or \u00abB A\u00bb. Unfortunately, often it is impossible to send a letter directly from the city of the sender to the city of the receiver, that's why the letter is sent via some intermediate cities. Post officers never send a letter in such a way that the route of this letter contains some city more than once. Bob is sure that the post officers stamp the letters accurately.\n\nThere are *n* stamps on the envelope of Bob's letter. He understands that the possible routes of this letter are only two. But the stamps are numerous, and Bob can't determine himself none of these routes. That's why he asks you to help him. Find one of the possible routes of the letter.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 amount of mail stamps on the envelope. Then there follow *n* lines with two integers each \u2014 description of the stamps. Each stamp is described with indexes of the cities between which a letter is sent. The indexes of cities are integers from 1 to 109. Indexes of all the cities are different. Every time the letter is sent from one city to another, exactly one stamp is put on the envelope.

There is a rating system describing skill level of each player, initially the rating of the *i*-th friend is *r**i*.\n\nThe friends decided to take part in the championship as a team. But they should have equal ratings to be allowed to compose a single team consisting of all *n* friends. So the friends are faced with the problem: how to make all their ratings equal.\n\nOne way to change ratings is to willingly lose in some matches. Friends can form a party consisting of two to five (but not more than *n*) friends and play a match in the game. When the party loses, the rating of each of its members decreases by 1. A rating can't become negative, so *r**i*<==<=0 doesn't change after losing.\n\nThe friends can take part in multiple matches, each time making a party from any subset of friends (but remember about constraints on party size: from 2 to 5 members).\n\nThe friends want to make their ratings equal but as high as possible.\n\nHelp the friends develop a strategy of losing the matches so that all their ratings become equal and the resulting rating is maximum possible.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of friends.\n\nThe second line contains *n* non-negative integers *r*1,<=*r*2,<=...,<=*r**n* (0<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=100), where *r**i* is the initial rating of the *i*-th friend.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line, print a single integer *R* \u2014 the final rating of each of the friends.\n\nIn the second line, print integer *t* \u2014 the number of matches the friends have to play. Each of the following *t* lines should contain *n* characters '0' or '1', where the *j*-th character of the *i*-th line is equal to:\n -  '0', if friend *j* should not play in match *i*, -  '1', if friend *j* should play in match *i*. \nEach line should contain between two and five characters '1', inclusive.\n\nThe value *t* should not exceed 104, it is guaranteed that such solution exists. \n\nRemember that you shouldn't minimize the value *t*, but you should maximize *R*. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5\\n4 5 1 7 4\\n', '2\\n1 2\\n', '3\\n1 1 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n8\\n01010\\n00011\\n01010\\n10010\\n00011\\n11000\\n00011\\n11000\\n', '0\\n2\\n11\\n11\\n', '1\\n0\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Reducing Fractions\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nTo confuse the opponents, the Galactic Empire represents fractions in an unusual format. The fractions are represented as two sets of integers. The product of numbers from the first set gives the fraction numerator, the product of numbers from the second set gives the fraction denominator. However, it turned out that the programs that work with fractions in this representations aren't complete, they lack supporting the operation of reducing fractions. Implement this operation and the Empire won't forget you.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains two space-separated integers *n*, *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) that show how many numbers the first set (the numerator) and the second set (the denominator) contain, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line contains *n* space-separated integers: *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=107) \u2014 the numbers that are multiplied to produce the numerator.\n\nThe third line contains *m* space-separated integers: *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=107) \u2014 the numbers that are multiplied to produce the denominator.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the answer to the problem in the form, similar to the form of the input data. The number of values in the sets you print *n**out*,<=*m**out* must satisfy the inequality 1<=\u2264<=*n**out*,<=*m**out*<=\u2264<=105, and the actual values in the sets *a**out*,<=*i* and *b**out*,<=*i* must satisfy the inequality 1<=\u2264<=*a**out*,<=*i*,<=*b**out*,<=*i*<=\u2264<=107. \n\nSeparate the values in the lines by spaces. The printed fraction must be reduced, that is, there mustn't be such integer *x* (*x*<=&gt;<=1), that the numerator and the denominator of the printed fraction are divisible by *x*. If there are several matching answers, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 2\\n100 5 2\\n50 10\\n', '4 3\\n2 5 10 20\\n100 1 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2 3\\n2 1\\n1 1 1\\n', '1 1\\n20\\n3\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first test sample the numerator equals 1000, the denominator equals 500.

Today he found one he wasn't able to solve himself, so he asks you to help.\n\nVasiliy is given *n* strings consisting of lowercase English letters. He wants them to be sorted in lexicographical order (as in the dictionary), but he is not allowed to swap any of them. The only operation he is allowed to do is to reverse any of them (first character becomes last, second becomes one before last and so on).\n\nTo reverse the *i*-th string Vasiliy has to spent *c**i* units of energy. He is interested in the minimum amount of energy he has to spent in order to have strings sorted in lexicographical order.\n\nString *A* is lexicographically smaller than string *B* if it is shorter than *B* (|*A*|<=&lt;<=|*B*|) and is its prefix, or if none of them is a prefix of the other and at the first position where they differ character in *A* is smaller than the character in *B*.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, two equal strings nearby do not break the condition of sequence being sorted lexicographically.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of strings.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *c**i* (0<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=109), the *i*-th of them is equal to the amount of energy Vasiliy has to spent in order to reverse the *i*-th string. \n\nThen follow *n* lines, each containing a string consisting of lowercase English letters. The total length of these strings doesn't exceed 100<=000.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf it is impossible to reverse some of the strings such that they will be located in lexicographical order, print <=-<=1. Otherwise, print the minimum total amount of energy Vasiliy has to spent.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2\\n1 2\\nba\\nac\\n', '3\\n1 3 1\\naa\\nba\\nac\\n', '2\\n5 5\\nbbb\\naaa\\n', '2\\n3 3\\naaa\\naa\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '1\\n', '-1\\n', '-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the second sample one has to reverse string 2 or string 3. To amount of energy required to reverse the string 3 is smaller.\n\nIn the third sample, both strings do not change after reverse and they go in the wrong order, so the answer is \u2009-\u20091.\n\nIn the fourth sample, both strings consists of characters 'a' only, but in the sorted order string \"aa\" should go before string \"aaa\", thus the answer is \u2009-\u20091.",

The goal of the game is to find an exit from the maze that looks like a perfect binary tree of height *h*. The player is initially standing at the root of the tree and the exit from the tree is located at some leaf node. \n\nLet's index all the leaf nodes from the left to the right from 1 to 2*h*. The exit is located at some node *n* where 1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2*h*, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!\n\nAmr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string \"LRLRLRLRL...\" (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:\n -  Character 'L' means \"go to the left child of the current node\"; -  Character 'R' means \"go to the right child of the current node\"; -  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node; -  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command; -  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node; -  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. \nNow Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?\n\nInput Specification:\nInput consists of two integers *h*,<=*n* (1<=\u2264<=*h*<=\u2264<=50, 1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2*h*).\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput a single integer representing the number of nodes (excluding the exit node) Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit by following this algorithm.\n\nDemo Input:\n['1 2\\n', '2 3\\n', '3 6\\n', '10 1024\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2', '5', '10', '2046']\n\nNote:\nA perfect binary tree of height *h* is a binary tree consisting of *h*\u2009+\u20091 levels. Level 0 consists of a single node called root, level *h* consists of 2<sup class=\"upper-index\">*h*</sup> nodes called leaves. Each node that is not a leaf has exactly two children, left and right one. \n\nFollowing picture illustrates the sample test number 3.

        "prompt": "Title: Spider's Web\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nPaw the Spider is making a web. Web-making is a real art, Paw has been learning to do it his whole life. Let's consider the structure of the web.\n\nThere are *n* main threads going from the center of the web. All main threads are located in one plane and divide it into *n* equal infinite sectors. The sectors are indexed from 1 to *n* in the clockwise direction. Sectors *i* and *i*<=+<=1 are adjacent for every *i*, 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*n*. In addition, sectors 1 and *n* are also adjacent.\n\nSome sectors have bridge threads. Each bridge connects the two main threads that make up this sector. The points at which the bridge is attached to the main threads will be called attachment points. Both attachment points of a bridge are at the same distance from the center of the web. At each attachment point exactly one bridge is attached. The bridges are adjacent if they are in the same sector, and there are no other bridges between them.\n\nA cell of the web is a trapezoid, which is located in one of the sectors and is bounded by two main threads and two adjacent bridges. You can see that the sides of the cell may have the attachment points of bridges from adjacent sectors. If the number of attachment points on one side of the cell is not equal to the number of attachment points on the other side, it creates an imbalance of pulling forces on this cell and this may eventually destroy the entire web. We'll call such a cell unstable. The perfect web does not contain unstable cells.\n\nUnstable cells are marked red in the figure. Stable cells are marked green.\n\nPaw the Spider isn't a skillful webmaker yet, he is only learning to make perfect webs. Help Paw to determine the number of unstable cells in the web he has just spun.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number of main threads.\n\nThe *i*-th of following *n* lines describe the bridges located in the *i*-th sector: first it contains integer *k**i* (1<=\u2264<=*k**i*<=\u2264<=105) equal to the number of bridges in the given sector. Then follow *k**i* different integers *p**ij* (1<=\u2264<=*p**ij*<=\u2264<=105;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*k**i*). Number *p**ij* equals the distance from the attachment points of the *j*-th bridge of the *i*-th sector to the center of the web.\n\nIt is guaranteed that any two bridges between adjacent sectors are attached at a different distance from the center of the web. It is guaranteed that the total number of the bridges doesn't exceed 105.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of unstable cells in Paw the Spider's web.\n\nDemo Input:\n['7\\n3 1 6 7\\n4 3 5 2 9\\n2 8 1\\n4 3 7 6 4\\n3 2 5 9\\n3 6 3 8\\n3 4 2 9\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['6']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Interactive Bulls and Cows (Easy)\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThis problem is a little bit unusual. Here you are to implement an interaction with a testing system. That means that you can make queries and get responses in the online mode. Please be sure to use the stream flushing operation after each query's output in order not to leave part of your output in some buffer. For example, in C++ you've got to use the fflush(stdout) function, in Java \u2014 call System.out.flush(), and in Pascal \u2014 flush(output).\n\nBulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls or Bulls and Cleots) is an old code-breaking paper and pencil game for two players, predating the similar commercially marketed board game Mastermind.\n\nOn a sheet of paper, the first player thinks a secret string. This string consists only of digits and has the length 4. The digits in the string must be all different, no two or more equal digits are allowed.\n\nThen the second player tries to guess his opponent's string. For every guess the first player gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are \"bulls\", if on different positions, they are \"cows\". Thus a response is a pair of numbers \u2014 the number of \"bulls\" and the number of \"cows\". A try can contain equal digits.\n\nMore formally, let's the secret string is *s* and the second player are trying to guess it with a string *x*. The number of \"bulls\" is a number of such positions *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=4) where *s*[*i*]<==<=*x*[*i*]. The number of \"cows\" is a number of such digits *c* that *s* contains *c* in the position *i* (i.e. *s*[*i*]<==<=*c*), *x* contains *c*, but *x*[*i*]<=\u2260<=*c*.\n\nFor example, the secret string is \"0427\", the opponent's try is \"0724\", then the answer is 2 bulls and 2 cows (the bulls are \"0\" and \"2\", the cows are \"4\" and \"7\"). If the secret string is \"0123\", the opponent's try is \"0330\", then the answer is 1 bull and 1 cow.\n\nIn this problem you are to guess the string *s* that the system has chosen. You only know that the chosen string consists of 4 distinct digits.\n\nYou can make queries to the testing system, each query is the output of a single 4-digit string. The answer to the query is the number of bulls and number of cows. If the system's response equals \"4 0\", that means the interaction with your problem is over and the program must terminate. That is possible for two reasons \u2014 the program either guessed the number *x* or made an invalid action (for example, printed letters instead of digits).\n\nYour program is allowed to do at most 50 queries.\n\nYou can hack solutions of other participants providing a 4-digit string containing distinct digits \u2014 the secret string.\n\nInput Specification:\nTo read answers to the queries, the program must use the standard input.\n\nThe program will receive pairs of non-negative integers in the input, one pair per line. The first number in a pair is a number of bulls and the second one is a number of cows of the string *s* and the string *x**i* printed by your program. If the system response equals \"4 0\", then your solution should terminate.\n\nThe testing system will let your program read the *i*-th pair of integers from the input only after your program displays the corresponding system query in the output: prints value *x**i* in a single line and executes operation flush.\n\nOutput Specification:\nThe program must use the standard output to print queries.\n\nYour program must output requests \u2014 4-digit strings *x*1,<=*x*2,<=..., one per line. After the output of each line the program must execute flush operation. The program should read the answer to the query from the standard input.\n\nYour program is allowed to do at most 50 queries.\n\nDemo Input:\n['0 1\\n2 0\\n1 1\\n0 4\\n2 1\\n4 0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['8000\\n0179\\n3159\\n3210\\n0112\\n0123']\n\nNote:\nThe secret string *s* in the example is \"0123\".",

That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.\n\nOrganizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.\n\nTournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored.

Her friends were so jealous of hers, that they created an actual game just to prove that she's not the best at games. The game is played on a directed acyclic graph (a DAG) with *n* vertices and *m* edges. There's a character written on each edge, a lowercase English letter.\n\nMax and Lucas are playing the game. Max goes first, then Lucas, then Max again and so on. Each player has a marble, initially located at some vertex. Each player in his/her turn should move his/her marble along some edge (a player can move the marble from vertex *v* to vertex *u* if there's an outgoing edge from *v* to *u*). If the player moves his/her marble from vertex *v* to vertex *u*, the \"character\" of that round is the character written on the edge from *v* to *u*. There's one additional rule; the ASCII code of character of round *i* should be greater than or equal to the ASCII code of character of round *i*<=-<=1 (for *i*<=&gt;<=1). The rounds are numbered for both players together, i.\u00a0e. Max goes in odd numbers, Lucas goes in even numbers. The player that can't make a move loses the game. The marbles may be at the same vertex at the same time.\n\nSince the game could take a while and Lucas and Max have to focus on finding Dart, they don't have time to play. So they asked you, if they both play optimally, who wins the game?\n\nYou have to determine the winner of the game for all initial positions of the marbles.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains two integers *n* and *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100, ).\n\nThe next *m* lines contain the edges.

There's at most one edge between any pair of vertices. It is guaranteed that the graph is acyclic.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *n* lines, a string of length *n* in each one.

Let's call two empty cells adjacent if they share a side.\n\nLet's call a connected component any non-extendible set of cells such that any two of them are connected by the path of adjacent cells.

An example of a simple statement is assignment.\n\nFor statements are compound statements: they contain one or several other statements.

Loop body is a block of statements indented one level further than the header of the loop. Loop body can contain both types of statements. Loop body can't be empty.\n\nYou are given a sequence of statements without indentation.

The point is as follows: count the number of distinct good substrings of some string *s*. To determine if a string is good or not the game uses rules. Overall there are *n* rules. Each rule is described by a group of three (*p*,<=*l*,<=*r*), where *p* is a string and *l* and *r* (*l*<=\u2264<=*r*) are integers. We\u2019ll say that string *t* complies with rule (*p*,<=*l*,<=*r*), if the number of occurrences of string *t* in string *p* lies between *l* and *r*, inclusive.

He already agreed with his friends that at certain points in time they will send requests to Fakebook. The load testing will last *n* minutes and in the *i*-th minute friends will send *a**i* requests.\n\nPolycarp plans to test Fakebook under a special kind of load. In case the information about Fakebook gets into the mass media, Polycarp hopes for a monotone increase of the load, followed by a monotone decrease of the interest to the service. Polycarp wants to test this form of load.\n\nYour task is to determine how many requests Polycarp must add so that before some moment the load on the server strictly increases and after that moment strictly decreases. Both the increasing part and the decreasing part can be empty (i. e. absent). The decrease should immediately follow the increase. In particular, the load with two equal neigbouring values is unacceptable.\n\nFor example, if the load is described with one of the arrays [1, 2, 8, 4, 3], [1, 3, 5] or [10], then such load satisfies Polycarp (in each of the cases there is an increasing part, immediately followed with a decreasing part). If the load is described with one of the arrays [1, 2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2] or [10, 10], then such load does not satisfy Polycarp.\n\nHelp Polycarp to make the minimum number of additional requests, so that the resulting load satisfies Polycarp. He can make any number of additional requests at any minute from 1 to *n*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000) \u2014 the duration of the load testing.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109), where *a**i* is the number of requests from friends in the *i*-th minute of the load testing.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the minimum number of additional requests from Polycarp that would make the load strictly increasing in the beginning and then strictly decreasing afterwards.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5\\n1 4 3 2 5\\n', '5\\n1 2 2 2 1\\n', '7\\n10 20 40 50 70 90 30\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['6\\n', '1\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example Polycarp must make two additional requests in the third minute and four additional requests in the fourth minute. So the resulting load will look like: [1, 4, 5, 6, 5]. In total, Polycarp will make 6 additional requests.\n\nIn the second example it is enough to make one additional request in the third minute, so the answer is 1.\n\nIn the third example the load already satisfies all conditions described in the statement, so the answer is 0.",

        "prompt": "Title: Embassy Queue\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIn an embassy of a well-known kingdom an electronic queue is organised. Every person who comes to the embassy, needs to make the following three actions: show the ID, pay money to the cashier and be fingerprinted. Besides, the actions should be performed in the given order.\n\nFor each action several separate windows are singled out: *k*1 separate windows for the first action (the first type windows), *k*2 windows for the second one (the second type windows), and *k*3 for the third one (the third type windows). The service time for one person in any of the first type window equals to *t*1. Similarly, it takes *t*2 time to serve a person in any of the second type windows. And it takes *t*3 to serve one person in any of the third type windows. Thus, the service time depends only on the window type and is independent from the person who is applying for visa.\n\nAt some moment *n* people come to the embassy, the *i*-th person comes at the moment of time *c**i*. The person is registered under some number. After that he sits in the hall and waits for his number to be shown on a special board. Besides the person's number the board shows the number of the window where one should go and the person goes there immediately. Let's consider that the time needed to approach the window is negligible. The table can show information for no more than one person at a time. The electronic queue works so as to immediately start working with the person who has approached the window, as there are no other people in front of the window.\n\nThe Client Service Quality inspectors noticed that several people spend too much time in the embassy (this is particularly tiresome as the embassy has no mobile phone reception and 3G). It was decided to organise the system so that the largest time a person spends in the embassy were minimum. Help the inspectors organise the queue. Consider that all actions except for being served in at the window, happen instantly.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers *k*1, *k*2, *k*3 (1<=\u2264<=*k**i*<=\u2264<=109), they are the number of windows of the first, second and third type correspondingly.\n\nThe second line contains three space-separated integers *t*1, *t*2, *t*3 (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=105), they are the periods of time needed to serve one person in the window of the first, second and third type correspondingly. \n\nThe third line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105), it is the number of people.\n\nThe fourth line contains *n* space-separated integers *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=109) in the non-decreasing order; *c**i* is the time when the person number *i* comes to the embassy.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the single number, the maximum time a person will spend in the embassy if the queue is organized optimally.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams (also you may use the %I64d specificator).\n\nDemo Input:\n['1 1 1\\n1 1 1\\n5\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n', '2 1 1\\n5 1 1\\n5\\n1 2 3 3 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['7\\n', '13\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first test 5 people come simultaneously at the moment of time equal to 1. There is one window of every type, it takes 1 unit of time to be served at each window. That's why the maximal time a person spends in the embassy is the time needed to be served at the windows (3 units of time) plus the time the last person who comes to the first window waits (4 units of time).\n\n Windows in the second test work like this:\n\nThe first window of the first type: [1,\u20096) \u2014 the first person, [6,\u200911) \u2014 third person, [11,\u200916) \u2014 fifth person\n\nThe second window of the first type: [2,\u20097) \u2014 the second person, [7,\u200912) \u2014 the fourth person\n\nThe only second type window: [6,\u20097) \u2014 first, [7,\u20098) \u2014 second, [11,\u200912) \u2014 third, [12,\u200913) \u2014 fourth, [16,\u200917) \u2014 fifth\n\nThe only third type window: [7,\u20098) \u2014 first, [8,\u20099) \u2014 second, [12,\u200913) \u2014 third, [13,\u200914) \u2014 fourth, [17,\u200918) \u2014 fifth\n\nWe can see that it takes most time to serve the fifth person.",

        "prompt": "Title: Mysterious Present\n\nTime Limit: 1 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 64 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nPeter decided to wish happy birthday to his friend from Australia and send him a card. To make his present more mysterious, he decided to make a chain. Chain here is such a sequence of envelopes *A*<==<={*a*1,<=<=*a*2,<=<=...,<=<=*a**n*}, where the width and the height of the *i*-th envelope is strictly higher than the width and the height of the (*i*<=<=-<=<=1)-th envelope respectively. Chain size is the number of envelopes in the chain. \n\nPeter wants to make the chain of the maximum size from the envelopes he has, the chain should be such, that he'll be able to put a card into it. The card fits into the chain if its width and height is lower than the width and the height of the smallest envelope in the chain respectively. It's forbidden to turn the card and the envelopes. \n\nPeter has very many envelopes and very little time, this hard task is entrusted to you.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integers *n*, *w*, *h* (1<=<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5000, 1<=\u2264<=*w*,<=<=*h*<=<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 amount of envelopes Peter has, the card width and height respectively. Then there follow *n* lines, each of them contains two integer numbers *w**i* and *h**i* \u2014 width and height of the *i*-th envelope (1<=\u2264<=*w**i*,<=<=*h**i*<=\u2264<=106).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print the maximum chain size. In the second line print the numbers of the envelopes (separated by space), forming the required chain, starting with the number of the smallest envelope. Remember, please, that the card should fit into the smallest envelope. If the chain of maximum size is not unique, print any of the answers.\n\nIf the card does not fit into any of the envelopes, print number 0 in the single line.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 1 1\\n2 2\\n2 2\\n', '3 3 3\\n5 4\\n12 11\\n9 8\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n1 \\n', '3\\n1 3 2 \\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

We say that \u03c8(*n*) is the reflection of *n*. For example, reflection of 192 equals 807. Note that leading zeros (if any) should be omitted.

        "prompt": "Title: Petya and File System\n\nTime Limit: 3 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nRecently, on a programming lesson little Petya showed how quickly he can create files and folders on the computer. But he got soon fed up with this activity, and he decided to do a much more useful thing. He decided to calculate what folder contains most subfolders (including nested folders, nested folders of nested folders, and so on) and what folder contains most files (including the files in the subfolders).\n\nMore formally, the subfolders of the folder are all its directly nested folders and the subfolders of these nested folders. The given folder is not considered the subfolder of itself. A file is regarded as lying in a folder, if and only if it either lies directly in this folder, or lies in some subfolder of the folder.\n\nFor a better understanding of how to count subfolders and files for calculating the answer, see notes and answers to the samples.\n\nYou are given a few files that Petya has managed to create. The path to each file looks as follows:\n\n*diskName*:\\*folder*1\\*folder*2\\...\\ *folder**n*\\*fileName* \n-  *diskName* is single capital letter from the set {C,D,E,F,G}.-  *folder*1, ..., *folder**n* are folder names. Each folder name is nonempty sequence of lowercase Latin letters and digits from 0 to 9. (*n*<=\u2265<=1)-  *fileName* is a file name in the form of *name*.*extension*, where the *name* and the *extension* are nonempty sequences of lowercase Latin letters and digits from 0 to 9. \nIt is also known that there is no file whose path looks like *diskName*:\\*fileName*. That is, each file is stored in some folder, but there are no files directly in the root. Also let us assume that the disk root is not a folder.\n\nHelp Petya to find the largest number of subfolders, which can be in some folder, and the largest number of files that can be in some folder, counting all its subfolders.\n\nInput Specification:\nEach line of input data contains the description of one file path. The length of each line does not exceed 100, and overall there are no more than 100 lines. It is guaranteed, that all the paths are correct and meet the above rules. It is also guaranteed, that there are no two completely equal lines. That is, each file is described exactly once.\n\nThere is at least one line in the input data.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint two space-separated numbers. The first one is the maximal number of possible subfolders in a folder (including nested folders, nested folders of nested folders, and so on). The second one is the maximal number of files in a folder (including nested files in subfolders). Note that the disks are not regarded as folders.\n\nDemo Input:\n['C:\\\\folder1\\\\file1.txt', 'C:\\\\folder1\\\\folder2\\\\folder3\\\\file1.txt\\nC:\\\\folder1\\\\folder2\\\\folder4\\\\file1.txt\\nD:\\\\folder1\\\\file1.txt\\n', 'C:\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file.txt\\nC:\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file2\\\\file.txt']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0 1', '3 2', '4 2']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample we have one folder on the \"C\" disk. It has no subfolders, which is why the first number in the answer is 0. But this folder contains one file, so the second number of the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second sample we have several different folders. Consider the \"folder1\" folder on the \"C\" disk. This folder directly contains one folder, \"folder2\". The \"folder2\" folder contains two more folders \u2014 \"folder3\" and \"folder4\". Thus, the \"folder1\" folder on the \"C\" drive has exactly 3 subfolders. Also this folder contains two files, even though they do not lie directly in the folder, but they are located in subfolders of \"folder1\".\n\nIn the third example we see that the names of some folders and some subfolders are identical. Consider the \"file\" folder, which lies directly on the \"C\" disk. That folder contains another \"file\" folder, which in turn contains another \"file\" folder, which contains two more folders, \"file\" and \"file2\". Thus, the \"file\" folder, which lies directly on the \"C\" disk, contains 4 subfolders.",

        "prompt": "Title: Message\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nDr. Moriarty is about to send a message to Sherlock Holmes. He has a string *s*. \n\nString *p* is called a substring of string *s* if you can read it starting from some position in the string *s*. For example, string \"aba\" has six substrings: \"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aba\".\n\nDr. Moriarty plans to take string *s* and cut out some substring from it, let's call it *t*. Then he needs to change the substring *t* zero or more times. As a result, he should obtain a fixed string *u* (which is the string that should be sent to Sherlock Holmes). One change is defined as making one of the following actions: \n -  Insert one letter to any end of the string. -  Delete one letter from any end of the string. -  Change one letter into any other one. \nMoriarty is very smart and after he chooses some substring *t*, he always makes the minimal number of changes to obtain *u*. \n\nHelp Moriarty choose the best substring *t* from all substrings of the string *s*. The substring *t* should minimize the number of changes Moriarty should make to obtain the string *u* from it.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a non-empty string *s*, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

There are *n* skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of *n* positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of *n* positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.\n\nPavel has a plan: a permutation *p* and a sequence *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n*, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position *i* to position *p**i*, and if *b**i* equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.\n\nUnfortunately, not every pair of permutation *p* and sequence *b* suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation *p* and the given sequence *b* he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2*n* placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.\n\nThere is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook.

On the last lesson, her strict teacher Dvastan gave she new exercise.\n\nYou are given geometric progression *b* defined by two integers *b*1 and *q*. Remind that a geometric progression is a sequence of integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=*b*3,<=..., where for each *i*<=&gt;<=1 the respective term satisfies the condition *b**i*<==<=*b**i*<=-<=1\u00b7*q*, where *q* is called the common ratio of the progression. Progressions in Uzhlyandia are unusual: both *b*1 and *q* can equal 0. Also, Dvastan gave Masha *m* \"bad\" integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m*, and an integer *l*.\n\nMasha writes all progression terms one by one onto the board (including repetitive) while condition |*b**i*|<=\u2264<=*l* is satisfied (|*x*| means absolute value of *x*). There is an exception: if a term equals one of the \"bad\" integers, Masha skips it (doesn't write onto the board) and moves forward to the next term.\n\nBut the lesson is going to end soon, so Masha has to calculate how many integers will be written on the board. In order not to get into depression, Masha asked you for help: help her calculate how many numbers she will write, or print \"inf\" in case she needs to write infinitely many integers.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains four integers *b*1, *q*, *l*, *m* (-109<=\u2264<=*b*1,<=*q*<=\u2264<=109, 1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=109, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the initial term and the common ratio of progression, absolute value of maximal number that can be written on the board and the number of \"bad\" integers, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *m* distinct integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m* (-109<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 numbers that will never be written on the board.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the only integer, meaning the number of progression terms that will be written on the board if it is finite, or \"inf\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 2 30 4\\n6 14 25 48\\n', '123 1 2143435 4\\n123 11 -5453 141245\\n', '123 1 2143435 4\\n54343 -13 6 124\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3', '0', 'inf']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample case, Masha will write integers 3,\u200912,\u200924. Progression term 6 will be skipped because it is a \"bad\" integer.

He has to pass exams on *m* subjects. Subjects are numbered from 1 to *m*.\n\nAbout every day we know exam for which one of *m* subjects can be passed on that day. Perhaps, some day you can't pass any exam. It is not allowed to pass more than one exam on any day. \n\nOn each day Vasiliy can either pass the exam of that day (it takes the whole day) or prepare all day for some exam or have a rest. \n\nAbout each subject Vasiliy know a number *a**i*\u00a0\u2014 the number of days he should prepare to pass the exam number *i*. Vasiliy can switch subjects while preparing for exams, it is not necessary to prepare continuously during *a**i* days for the exam number *i*. He can mix the order of preparation for exams in any way.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum number of days in which Vasiliy can pass all exams, or determine that it is impossible. Each exam should be passed exactly one time.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of days in the exam period and the number of subjects. \n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *d*1,<=*d*2,<=...,<=*d**n* (0<=\u2264<=*d**i*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *d**i* is the number of subject, the exam of which can be passed on the day number *i*. If *d**i* equals 0, it is not allowed to pass any exams on the day number *i*. \n\nThe third line contains *m* positive integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=105), where *a**i* is the number of days that are needed to prepare before passing the exam on the subject *i*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of days in which Vasiliy can pass all exams.

On the first and the second day he can prepare for the exam number 1 and pass it on the fifth day, prepare for the exam number 2 on the third day and pass it on the fourth day.\n\nIn the second example Vasiliy should prepare for the exam number 3 during the first four days and pass it on the fifth day. Then on the sixth day he should prepare for the exam number 2 and then pass it on the seventh day. After that he needs to prepare for the exam number 1 on the eighth day and pass it on the ninth day. \n\nIn the third example Vasiliy can't pass the only exam because he hasn't anough time to prepare for it.",

As the lecture was boring, Vasya decided to complete the picture by composing a graph *G* with the following properties: \n -  *G* has exactly *n* vertices, numbered from 1 to *n*. -  For all pairs of vertices *i* and *j*, where *i*<=\u2260<=*j*, there is an edge connecting them if and only if characters *s**i* and *s**j* are either equal or neighbouring in the alphabet. That is, letters in pairs \"a\"-\"b\" and \"b\"-\"c\" are neighbouring, while letters \"a\"-\"c\" are not. \nVasya painted the resulting graph near the string and then erased the string. Next day Vasya's friend Petya came to a lecture and found some graph at his desk. He had heard of Vasya's adventure and now he wants to find out whether it could be the original graph *G*, painted by Vasya. In order to verify this, Petya needs to know whether there exists a string *s*, such that if Vasya used this *s* he would produce the given graph *G*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* \u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices and edges in the graph found by Petya, respectively.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines contains two integers *u**i* and *v**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*u**i*<=\u2260<=*v**i*)\u00a0\u2014 the edges of the graph *G*. It is guaranteed, that there are no multiple edges, that is any pair of vertexes appear in this list no more than once.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print \"Yes\" (without the quotes), if the string *s* Petya is interested in really exists and \"No\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\n\nIf the string *s* exists, then print it on the second line of the output. The length of *s* must be exactly *n*, it must consist of only letters \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" only, and the graph built using this string must coincide with *G*. If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 1\\n1 2\\n', '4 3\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n1 4\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['Yes\\naa\\n', 'No\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample you are given a graph made of two vertices with an edge between them. So, these vertices can correspond to both the same and adjacent letters.

He was in such a hurry to launch it for the first time that he plugged in the power wires without giving it a proper glance and started experimenting right away. After a while Mike observed that the wires ended up entangled and now have to be untangled again.\n\nThe device is powered by two wires \"plus\" and \"minus\". The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view):\n\nMike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other. Mike also noticed that on the left side, the \"plus\" wire is always plugged into the top contact (as seen on the picture). He would like to untangle the wires without unplugging them and without moving the device. Determine if it is possible to do that. A wire can be freely moved and stretched on the floor, but cannot be cut.\n\nTo understand the problem better please read the notes to the test samples.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe single line of the input contains a sequence of characters \"+\" and \"-\" of length *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000). The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) position of the sequence contains the character \"+\", if on the *i*-th step from the wall the \"plus\" wire runs above the \"minus\" wire, and the character \"-\" otherwise.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint either \"Yes\" (without the quotes) if the wires can be untangled or \"No\" (without the quotes) if the wires cannot be untangled.\n\nDemo Input:\n['-++-\\n', '+-\\n', '++\\n', '-\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['Yes\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n', 'No\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe first testcase corresponds to the picture in the statement. To untangle the wires, one can first move the \"plus\" wire lower, thus eliminating the two crosses in the middle, and then draw it under the \"minus\" wire, eliminating also the remaining two crosses.\n\nIn the second testcase the \"plus\" wire makes one full revolution around the \"minus\" wire. Thus the wires cannot be untangled: \n\nIn the third testcase the \"plus\" wire simply runs above the \"minus\" wire twice in sequence. The wires can be untangled by lifting \"plus\" and moving it higher: \n\nIn the fourth testcase the \"minus\" wire runs above the \"plus\" wire once. The wires cannot be untangled without moving the device itself:",

Are you busy? Will you save us?\".\n\nShe wants to let more people know about it, so she defines *f**i*<==<= \"What are you doing while sending \"*f**i*<=-<=1\"? Are you busy? Will you send \"*f**i*<=-<=1\"?\" for all *i*<=\u2265<=1.\n\nFor example, *f*1 is\n\n\"What are you doing while sending \"What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy?

Note that the quotes in the very beginning and in the very end are for clarity and are not a part of *f*1.\n\nIt can be seen that the characters in *f**i* are letters, question marks, (possibly) quotation marks and spaces.\n\nNephren will ask the little leprechauns *q* times. Each time she will let them find the *k*-th character of *f**n*. The characters are indexed starting from 1. If *f**n* consists of less than *k* characters, output '.' (without quotes).\n\nCan you answer her queries?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains one integer *q* (1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=10)\u00a0\u2014 the number of Nephren's questions.\n\nEach of the next *q* lines describes Nephren's question and contains two integers *n* and *k* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=1018).\n\nOutput Specification:\nOne line containing *q* characters.

        "prompt": "Title: New Year and Rating\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nEvery Codeforces user has rating, described with one integer, possibly negative or zero. Users are divided into two divisions. The first division is for users with rating 1900 or higher. Those with rating 1899 or lower belong to the second division. In every contest, according to one's performance, his or her rating changes by some value, possibly negative or zero.\n\nLimak competed in *n* contests in the year 2016. He remembers that in the *i*-th contest he competed in the division *d**i* (i.e. he belonged to this division just before the start of this contest) and his rating changed by *c**i* just after the contest. Note that negative *c**i* denotes the loss of rating.\n\nWhat is the maximum possible rating Limak can have right now, after all *n* contests? If his rating may be arbitrarily big, print \"Infinity\". If there is no scenario matching the given information, print \"Impossible\".\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000).\n\nThe *i*-th of next *n* lines contains two integers *c**i* and *d**i* (<=-<=100<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=100, 1<=\u2264<=*d**i*<=\u2264<=2), describing Limak's rating change after the *i*-th contest and his division during the *i*-th contest contest.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf Limak's current rating can be arbitrarily big, print \"Infinity\" (without quotes).

In the last contest of the year he gets \u2009+\u20098 and ends the year with rating 1907. \nIn the second sample, it's impossible that Limak is in the division 1, his rating increases by 57 and after that Limak is in the division 2 in the second contest.",

Recently, the Institute staff challenged the Beaver with a new problem. The problem is as follows.\n\nThere is a collection of *n* proteins (not necessarily distinct). Each protein is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The problem that the scientists offered to the Beaver is to select a subcollection of size *k* from the initial collection of proteins so that the representativity of the selected subset of proteins is maximum possible.\n\nThe Smart Beaver from ABBYY did some research and came to the conclusion that the representativity of a collection of proteins can be evaluated by a single number, which is simply calculated. Let's suppose we have a collection {*a*1,<=...,<=*a**k*} consisting of *k* strings describing proteins. The representativity of this collection is the following value:\n\nwhere *f*(*x*,<=*y*) is the length of the longest common prefix of strings *x* and *y*; for example, *f*(\"abc\", \"abd\")<==<=2, and *f*(\"ab\", \"bcd\")<==<=0.\n\nThus, the representativity of collection of proteins {\"abc\", \"abd\", \"abe\"} equals 6, and the representativity of collection {\"aaa\", \"ba\", \"ba\"} equals 2.\n\nHaving discovered that, the Smart Beaver from ABBYY asked the Cup contestants to write a program that selects, from the given collection of proteins, a subcollection of size *k* which has the largest possible value of representativity. Help him to solve this problem!\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*), separated by a single space. The following *n* lines contain the descriptions of proteins, one per line. Each protein is a non-empty string of no more than 500 characters consisting of only lowercase Latin letters (a...z). Some of the strings may be equal.\n\nThe input limitations for getting 20 points are: \n -  1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=20 \nThe input limitations for getting 50 points are: \n -  1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100 \nThe input limitations for getting 100 points are: \n -  1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number denoting the largest possible value of representativity that a subcollection of size *k* of the given collection of proteins can have.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 2\\naba\\nbzd\\nabq\\n', '4 3\\neee\\nrrr\\nttt\\nqqq\\n', '4 3\\naaa\\nabba\\nabbc\\nabbd\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '0\\n', '9\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Stairs and Elevators\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIn the year of $30XX$ participants of some world programming championship live in a single large hotel. The hotel has $n$ floors. Each floor has $m$ sections with a single corridor connecting all of them. The sections are enumerated from $1$ to $m$ along the corridor, and all sections with equal numbers on different floors are located exactly one above the other. Thus, the hotel can be represented as a rectangle of height $n$ and width $m$. We can denote sections with pairs of integers $(i, j)$, where $i$ is the floor, and $j$ is the section number on the floor.\n\nThe guests can walk along the corridor on each floor, use stairs and elevators. Each stairs or elevator occupies all sections $(1, x)$, $(2, x)$, $\\ldots$, $(n, x)$ for some $x$ between $1$ and $m$. All sections not occupied with stairs or elevators contain guest rooms. It takes one time unit to move between neighboring sections on the same floor or to move one floor up or down using stairs. It takes one time unit to move up to $v$ floors in any direction using an elevator. You can assume you don't have to wait for an elevator, and the time needed to enter or exit an elevator is negligible.\n\nYou are to process $q$ queries. Each query is a question \"what is the minimum time needed to go from a room in section $(x_1, y_1)$ to a room in section $(x_2, y_2)$?\"\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains five integers $n, m, c_l, c_e, v$ ($2 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^8$, $0 \\leq c_l, c_e \\leq 10^5$, $1 \\leq c_l + c_e \\leq m - 1$, $1 \\leq v \\leq n - 1$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of floors and section on each floor, the number of stairs, the number of elevators and the maximum speed of an elevator, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $c_l$ integers $l_1, \\ldots, l_{c_l}$ in increasing order ($1 \\leq l_i \\leq m$), denoting the positions of the stairs. If $c_l = 0$, the second line is empty.\n\nThe third line contains $c_e$ integers $e_1, \\ldots, e_{c_e}$ in increasing order, denoting the elevators positions in the same format. It is guaranteed that all integers $l_i$ and $e_i$ are distinct.\n\nThe fourth line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \\leq q \\leq 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains four integers $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$ ($1 \\leq x_1, x_2 \\leq n$, $1 \\leq y_1, y_2 \\leq m$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of starting and finishing sections for the query. It is guaranteed that the starting and finishing sections are distinct. It is also guaranteed that these sections contain guest rooms, i.\u00a0e. $y_1$ and $y_2$ are not among $l_i$ and $e_i$.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint $q$ integers, one per line\u00a0\u2014 the answers for the queries.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 6 1 1 3\\n2\\n5\\n3\\n1 1 5 6\\n1 3 5 4\\n3 3 5 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['7\\n5\\n4\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first query the optimal way is to go to the elevator in the 5-th section in four time units, use it to go to the fifth floor in two time units and go to the destination in one more time unit.\n\nIn the second query it is still optimal to use the elevator, but in the third query it is better to use the stairs in the section 2.",

        "prompt": "Title: Tic-tac-toe\n\nTime Limit: 1 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 64 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nCertainly, everyone is familiar with tic-tac-toe game. The rules are very simple indeed. Two players take turns marking the cells in a 3<=\u00d7<=3 grid (one player always draws crosses, the other \u2014 noughts). The player who succeeds first in placing three of his marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line wins, and the game is finished. The player who draws crosses goes first. If the grid is filled, but neither Xs, nor 0s form the required line, a draw is announced.\n\nYou are given a 3<=\u00d7<=3 grid, each grid cell is empty, or occupied by a cross or a nought. You have to find the player (first or second), whose turn is next, or print one of the verdicts below: \n -  illegal \u2014 if the given board layout can't appear during a valid game; -  the first player won \u2014 if in the given board layout the first player has just won; -  the second player won \u2014 if in the given board layout the second player has just won; -  draw \u2014 if the given board layout has just let to a draw.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input consists of three lines, each of the lines contains characters \".\", \"X\" or \"0\" (a period, a capital letter X, or a digit zero).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint one of the six verdicts: first, second, illegal, the first player won, the second player won or draw.\n\nDemo Input:\n['X0X\\n.0.\\n.X.\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['second\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: My pretty girl Noora\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIn Pavlopolis University where Noora studies it was decided to hold beauty contest \"Miss Pavlopolis University\". Let's describe the process of choosing the most beautiful girl in the university in more detail.\n\nThe contest is held in several stages. Suppose that exactly *n* girls participate in the competition initially. All the participants are divided into equal groups, *x* participants in each group. Furthermore the number *x* is chosen arbitrarily, i. e. on every stage number *x* can be different. Within each group the jury of the contest compares beauty of the girls in the format \"each with each\". In this way, if group consists of *x* girls, then  comparisons occur. Then, from each group, the most beautiful participant is selected. Selected girls enter the next stage of the competition. Thus if *n* girls were divided into groups, *x* participants in each group, then exactly  participants will enter the next stage. The contest continues until there is exactly one girl left who will be \"Miss Pavlopolis University\"\n\nBut for the jury this contest is a very tedious task. They would like to divide the girls into groups in each stage so that the total number of pairwise comparisons of the girls is as few as possible. Let *f*(*n*) be the minimal total number of comparisons that should be made to select the most beautiful participant, if we admit *n* girls to the first stage.\n\nThe organizers of the competition are insane. They give Noora three integers *t*, *l* and *r* and ask the poor girl to calculate the value of the following expression: *t*0\u00b7*f*(*l*)<=+<=*t*1\u00b7*f*(*l*<=+<=1)<=+<=...<=+<=*t**r*<=-<=*l*\u00b7*f*(*r*). However, since the value of this expression can be quite large the organizers ask her to calculate it modulo 109<=+<=7. If Noora can calculate the value of this expression the organizers promise her to help during the beauty contest. But the poor girl is not strong in mathematics, so she turned for help to Leha and he turned to you.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first and single line contains three integers *t*, *l* and *r* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=&lt;<=109<=+<=7,<=2<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=5\u00b7106).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print single integer \u2014 the value of the expression modulo 109<=+<=7.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 2 4\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['19\\n']\n\nNote:\nConsider the sample.\n\nIt is necessary to find the value of <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/3ecc798906ae9e9852061ba2dd5cf6b8fce7753b.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.\n\n*f*(2)\u2009=\u20091. From two girls you can form only one group of two people, in which there will be one comparison.\n\n*f*(3)\u2009=\u20093. From three girls you can form only one group of three people, in which there will be three comparisons.\n\n*f*(4)\u2009=\u20093. From four girls you can form two groups of two girls each. Then at the first stage there will be two comparisons, one in each of the two groups. In the second stage there will be two girls and there will be one comparison between them. Total 2\u2009+\u20091\u2009=\u20093 comparisons. You can also leave all girls in same group in the first stage. Then <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/fcc6c9e72a1525cc01abbfb89094669a9d37d3b1.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> comparisons will occur. Obviously, it's better to split girls into groups in the first way.\n\nThen the value of the expression is <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/2c5a0f75c9d910ec77b2fe675e690de453060631.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.",

        "prompt": "Title: Transmigration\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIn Disgaea as in most role-playing games, characters have skills that determine the character's ability to use certain weapons or spells. If the character does not have the necessary skill, he cannot use it. The skill level is represented as an integer that increases when you use this skill. Different character classes are characterized by different skills. \n\nUnfortunately, the skills that are uncommon for the given character's class are quite difficult to obtain. To avoid this limitation, there is the so-called transmigration. \n\nTransmigration is reincarnation of the character in a new creature. His soul shifts to a new body and retains part of his experience from the previous life. \n\nAs a result of transmigration the new character gets all the skills of the old character and the skill levels are reduced according to the *k* coefficient (if the skill level was equal to *x*, then after transmigration it becomes equal to [*kx*], where [*y*] is the integral part of *y*). If some skill's levels are strictly less than 100, these skills are forgotten (the character does not have them any more). After that the new character also gains the skills that are specific for his class, but are new to him. The levels of those additional skills are set to 0. \n\nThus, one can create a character with skills specific for completely different character classes via transmigrations. For example, creating a mage archer or a thief warrior is possible. \n\nYou are suggested to solve the following problem: what skills will the character have after transmigration and what will the levels of those skills be?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three numbers *n*, *m* and *k* \u2014 the number of skills the current character has, the number of skills specific for the class into which the character is going to transmigrate and the reducing coefficient respectively; *n* and *m* are integers, and *k* is a real number with exactly two digits after decimal point (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=20, 0.01<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=0.99).\n\nThen follow *n* lines, each of which describes a character's skill in the form \"*name* *exp*\" \u2014 the skill's name and the character's skill level: *name* is a string and *exp* is an integer in range from 0 to 9999, inclusive. \n\nThen follow *m* lines each of which contains names of skills specific for the class, into which the character transmigrates. \n\nAll names consist of lowercase Latin letters and their lengths can range from 1 to 20 characters, inclusive. All character's skills have distinct names. Besides the skills specific for the class into which the player transmigrates also have distinct names.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint on the first line number *z* \u2014 the number of skills the character will have after the transmigration. Then print *z* lines, on each of which print a skill's name and level, separated by a single space. The skills should be given in the lexicographical order.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 4 0.75\\naxe 350\\nimpaler 300\\nionize 80\\nmegafire 120\\nmagicboost 220\\nheal\\nmegafire\\nshield\\nmagicboost\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['6\\naxe 262\\nheal 0\\nimpaler 225\\nmagicboost 165\\nmegafire 0\\nshield 0\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Mahmoud and a Message\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nMahmoud wrote a message *s* of length *n*. He wants to send it as a birthday present to his friend Moaz who likes strings. He wrote it on a magical paper but he was surprised because some characters disappeared while writing the string. That's because this magical paper doesn't allow character number *i* in the English alphabet to be written on it in a string of length more than *a**i*. For example, if *a*1<==<=2 he can't write character 'a' on this paper in a string of length 3 or more. String \"aa\" is allowed while string \"aaa\" is not.\n\nMahmoud decided to split the message into some non-empty substrings so that he can write every substring on an independent magical paper and fulfill the condition. The sum of their lengths should be *n* and they shouldn't overlap. For example, if *a*1<==<=2 and he wants to send string \"aaa\", he can split it into \"a\" and \"aa\" and use 2 magical papers, or into \"a\", \"a\" and \"a\" and use 3 magical papers. He can't split it into \"aa\" and \"aa\" because the sum of their lengths is greater than *n*. He can split the message into single string if it fulfills the conditions.\n\nA substring of string *s* is a string that consists of some consecutive characters from string *s*, strings \"ab\", \"abc\" and \"b\" are substrings of string \"abc\", while strings \"acb\" and \"ac\" are not. Any string is a substring of itself.\n\nWhile Mahmoud was thinking of how to split the message, Ehab told him that there are many ways to split it. After that Mahmoud asked you three questions: \n -  How many ways are there to split the string into substrings such that every substring fulfills the condition of the magical paper, the sum of their lengths is *n* and they don't overlap? Compute the answer modulo 109<=+<=7. -  What is the maximum length of a substring that can appear in some valid splitting? -  What is the minimum number of substrings the message can be spit in? \nTwo ways are considered different, if the sets of split positions differ. For example, splitting \"aa|a\" and \"a|aa\" are considered different splittings of message \"aaa\".\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=103) denoting the length of the message.\n\nThe second line contains the message *s* of length *n* that consists of lowercase English letters.\n\nThe third line contains 26 integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a*26 (1<=\u2264<=*a**x*<=\u2264<=103)\u00a0\u2014 the maximum lengths of substring each letter can appear in.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint three lines.\n\nIn the first line print the number of ways to split the message into substrings and fulfill the conditions mentioned in the problem modulo 109<=<=+<=<=7.\n\nIn the second line print the length of the longest substring over all the ways.\n\nIn the third line print the minimum number of substrings over all the ways.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\naab\\n2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\\n', '10\\nabcdeabcde\\n5 5 5 5 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n2\\n2\\n', '401\\n4\\n3\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example the three ways to split the message are: \n -  a|a|b -  aa|b -  a|ab \nThe longest substrings are \"aa\" and \"ab\" of length 2.\n\nThe minimum number of substrings is 2 in \"a|ab\" or \"aa|b\".\n\nNotice that \"aab\" is not a possible splitting because the letter 'a' appears in a substring of length 3, while *a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>\u2009=\u20092.",

        "prompt": "Title: Brevity is Soul of Wit\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nAs we communicate, we learn much new information. However, the process of communication takes too much time. It becomes clear if we look at the words we use in our everyday speech.\n\nWe can list many simple words consisting of many letters: \"information\", \"technologies\", \"university\", \"construction\", \"conservatoire\", \"refrigerator\", \"stopwatch\", \"windowsill\", \"electricity\", \"government\" and so on. Of course, we can continue listing those words ad infinitum. \n\nFortunately, the solution for that problem has been found. To make our speech clear and brief, we should replace the initial words with those that resemble them but are much shorter. This idea hasn't been brought into life yet, that's why you are chosen to improve the situation. \n\nLet's consider the following formal model of transforming words: we shall assume that one can use *n* words in a chat. For each words we shall introduce a notion of its shorter variant. We shall define shorter variant of an arbitrary word *s* as such word *t*, that meets the following conditions:\n -  it occurs in *s* as a subsequence, -  its length ranges from one to four characters. \nIn other words, the word *t* consists at least of one and at most of four characters that occur in the same order in the word *s*. Note that those characters do not necessarily follow in *s* immediately one after another. You are allowed not to shorten the initial word if its length does not exceed four characters.\n\nYou are given a list of *n* different words. Your task is to find a set of their shortened variants. The shortened variants of all words from the list should be different.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input file contains the only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200). Then *n* lines contain a set of different non-empty words that consist of lowercase Latin letters. The length of each word does not exceed 10 characters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf the solution exists, print in the output file exactly *n* lines, where the *i*-th line represents the shortened variant of the *i*-th word from the initial set. If there are several variants to solve the problem, print any of them. If there is no solution, print -1.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6\\nprivet\\nspasibo\\ncodeforces\\njava\\nmarmelad\\nnormalno\\n', '5\\naaa\\naa\\na\\naaaa\\naaaaa\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['pret\\nsps\\ncdfs\\njava\\nmama\\nnorm\\n', '-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Basketball Team\n\nTime Limit: 1 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nAs a German University in Cairo (GUC) student and a basketball player, Herr Wafa was delighted once he heard the news. GUC is finally participating in the Annual Basketball Competition (ABC). \n\nA team is to be formed of *n* players, all of which are GUC students. However, the team might have players belonging to different departments. There are *m* departments in GUC, numbered from 1 to *m*. Herr Wafa's department has number *h*. For each department *i*, Herr Wafa knows number *s**i* \u2014 how many students who play basketball belong to this department.\n\nHerr Wafa was also able to guarantee a spot on the team, using his special powers. But since he hates floating-point numbers, he needs your help at finding the probability that he will have at least one teammate belonging to his department. \n\nNote that every possible team containing Herr Wafa is equally probable. Consider all the students different from each other.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *m* and *h* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000,<=1<=\u2264<=*h*<=\u2264<=*m*) \u2014 the number of players on the team, the number of departments in GUC and Herr Wafa's department, correspondingly. \n\nThe second line contains a single-space-separated list of *m* integers *s**i* (1<=\u2264<=*s**i*<=\u2264<=100), denoting the number of students in the *i*-th department. Note that *s**h* includes Herr Wafa.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the probability that Herr Wafa will have at least one teammate from his department. If there is not enough basketball players in GUC to participate in ABC, print -1. The answer will be accepted if it has absolute or relative error not exceeding 10<=-<=6.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 2 1\\n2 1\\n', '3 2 1\\n1 1\\n', '3 2 1\\n2 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '-1\\n', '0.666667\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example all 3 players (2 from department 1 and 1 from department 2) must be chosen for the team.

Formally, the decree will be done! \n\nTo have the maximum sum in the budget, the Ministry decided to divide universities into pairs so that the total length of the required cable will be maximum. In other words, the total distance between universities in *k* pairs should be as large as possible. \n\nHelp the Ministry to find the maximum total distance. Of course, each university should be present in only one pair. Consider that all roads have the same length which is equal to 1.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=/<=2)\u00a0\u2014 the number of towns in Treeland and the number of university pairs. Consider that towns are numbered from 1 to *n*. \n\nThe second line contains 2*k* distinct integers *u*1,<=*u*2,<=...,<=*u*2*k* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 indices of towns in which universities are located. \n\nThe next *n*<=-<=1 line contains the description of roads. Each line contains the pair of integers *x**j* and *y**j* (1<=\u2264<=*x**j*,<=*y**j*<=\u2264<=*n*), which means that the *j*-th road connects towns *x**j* and *y**j*. All of them are two-way roads. You can move from any town to any other using only these roads.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the maximum possible sum of distances in the division of universities into *k* pairs.\n\nDemo Input:\n['7 2\\n1 5 6 2\\n1 3\\n3 2\\n4 5\\n3 7\\n4 3\\n4 6\\n', '9 3\\n3 2 1 6 5 9\\n8 9\\n3 2\\n2 7\\n3 4\\n7 6\\n4 5\\n2 1\\n2 8\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['6\\n', '9\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe figure below shows one of possible division into pairs in the first test. If you connect universities number 1 and 6 (marked in red) and universities number 2 and 5 (marked in blue) by using the cable, the total distance will equal 6 which will be the maximum sum in this example.",

        "prompt": "Title: Median Smoothing\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nA schoolboy named Vasya loves reading books on programming and mathematics. He has recently read an encyclopedia article that described the method of median smoothing (or median filter) and its many applications in science and engineering. Vasya liked the idea of the method very much, and he decided to try it in practice.\n\nApplying the simplest variant of median smoothing to the sequence of numbers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* will result a new sequence *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n* obtained by the following algorithm:\n -  *b*1<==<=*a*1, *b**n*<==<=*a**n*, that is, the first and the last number of the new sequence match the corresponding numbers of the original sequence. -  For *i*<==<=2,<=...,<=*n*<=-<=1 value *b**i* is equal to the median of three values *a**i*<=-<=1, *a**i* and *a**i*<=+<=1. \nThe median of a set of three numbers is the number that goes on the second place, when these three numbers are written in the non-decreasing order. For example, the median of the set 5, 1, 2 is number 2, and the median of set 1, 0, 1 is equal to 1.\n\nIn order to make the task easier, Vasya decided to apply the method to sequences consisting of zeros and ones only.\n\nHaving made the procedure once, Vasya looked at the resulting sequence and thought: what if I apply the algorithm to it once again, and then apply it to the next result, and so on? Vasya tried a couple of examples and found out that after some number of median smoothing algorithm applications the sequence can stop changing. We say that the sequence is stable, if it does not change when the median smoothing is applied to it.\n\nNow Vasya wonders, whether the sequence always eventually becomes stable. He asks you to write a program that, given a sequence of zeros and ones, will determine whether it ever becomes stable. Moreover, if it ever becomes stable, then you should determine what will it look like and how many times one needs to apply the median smoothing algorithm to initial sequence in order to obtain a stable one.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line of the input contains a single integer *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=500<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial sequence.\n\nThe next line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (*a**i*<==<=0 or *a**i*<==<=1), giving the initial sequence itself.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf the sequence will never become stable, print a single number <=-<=1.\n\nOtherwise, first print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of times one needs to apply the median smoothing algorithm to the initial sequence before it becomes is stable. In the second line print *n* numbers separated by a space \u00a0\u2014 the resulting sequence itself.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n0 0 1 1\\n', '5\\n0 1 0 1 0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0\\n0 0 1 1\\n', '2\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the second sample the stabilization occurs in two steps: <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/5a983e7baab048cbe43812cb997c15e9d7100231.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, and the sequence 00000 is obviously stable.",

When the robot is started, it generates the string *t* as a concatenation of these strings in the given order. The noise of the resulting string equals the noise of this concatenation.\n\nHelp Imp to find the maximum noise he can achieve by changing the order of the strings.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of strings in robot's memory.\n\nNext *n* lines contain the strings *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n*, one per line.

        "prompt": "Title: Tourist Problem\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIahub is a big fan of tourists. He wants to become a tourist himself, so he planned a trip. There are *n* destinations on a straight road that Iahub wants to visit. Iahub starts the excursion from kilometer 0. The *n* destinations are described by a non-negative integers sequence *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n*. The number *a**k* represents that the *k*th destination is at distance *a**k* kilometers from the starting point. No two destinations are located in the same place. \n\nIahub wants to visit each destination only once. Note that, crossing through a destination is not considered visiting, unless Iahub explicitly wants to visit it at that point. Also, after Iahub visits his last destination, he doesn't come back to kilometer 0, as he stops his trip at the last destination. \n\nThe distance between destination located at kilometer *x* and next destination, located at kilometer *y*, is |*x*<=-<=*y*| kilometers. We call a \"route\" an order of visiting the destinations. Iahub can visit destinations in any order he wants, as long as he visits all *n* destinations and he doesn't visit a destination more than once. \n\nIahub starts writing out on a paper all possible routes and for each of them, he notes the total distance he would walk. He's interested in the average number of kilometers he would walk by choosing a route. As he got bored of writing out all the routes, he asks you to help him.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).

If the *i*-th character is one, Galya has already made a shot to this cell. Otherwise, she hasn't. It is guaranteed that there are exactly *k* ones in this string.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print the minimum number of cells such that if Galya shoot at all of them, she would hit at least one ship.\n\nIn the second line print the cells Galya should shoot at.\n\nEach cell should be printed exactly once. You can print the cells in arbitrary order. The cells are numbered from 1 to *n*, starting from the left.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 1 2 1\\n00100\\n', '13 3 2 3\\n1000000010001\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n4 2\\n', '2\\n7 11\\n']\n\nNote:\nThere is one ship in the first sample. It can be either to the left or to the right from the shot Galya has already made (the \"1\" character). So, it is necessary to make two shots: one at the left part, and one at the right part.",

        "prompt": "Title: Buses\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 265 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nLittle boy Gerald studies at school which is quite far from his house. That's why he has to go there by bus every day. The way from home to school is represented by a segment of a straight line; the segment contains exactly *n*<=+<=1 bus stops. All of them are numbered with integers from 0 to *n* in the order in which they follow from Gerald's home. The bus stop by Gerald's home has number 0 and the bus stop by the school has number *n*.\n\nThere are *m* buses running between the house and the school: the *i*-th bus goes from stop *s**i* to *t**i* (*s**i*<=&lt;<=*t**i*), visiting all the intermediate stops in the order in which they follow on the segment. Besides, Gerald's no idiot and he wouldn't get off the bus until it is still possible to ride on it closer to the school (obviously, getting off would be completely pointless). In other words, Gerald can get on the *i*-th bus on any stop numbered from *s**i* to *t**i*<=-<=1 inclusive, but he can get off the *i*-th bus only on the bus stop *t**i*.\n\nGerald can't walk between the bus stops and he also can't move in the direction from the school to the house.\n\nGerald wants to know how many ways he has to get from home to school. Tell him this number. Two ways are considered different if Gerald crosses some segment between the stops on different buses. As the number of ways can be too much, find the remainder of a division of this number by 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers: *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109,<=0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105). Then follow *m* lines each containing two integers *s**i*,<=*t**i*. They are the numbers of starting stops and end stops of the buses (0<=\u2264<=*s**i*<=&lt;<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=*n*).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the only number \u2014 the number of ways to get to the school modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 2\\n0 1\\n1 2\\n', '3 2\\n0 1\\n1 2\\n', '5 5\\n0 1\\n0 2\\n0 3\\n0 4\\n0 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '0\\n', '16\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe first test has the only variant to get to school: first on bus number one to the bus stop number one; then on bus number two to the bus stop number two.\n\nIn the second test no bus goes to the third bus stop, where the school is positioned. Thus, the correct answer is 0.\n\nIn the third test Gerald can either get or not on any of the first four buses to get closer to the school. Thus, the correct answer is 2<sup class=\"upper-index\">4</sup>\u2009=\u200916.",

The dragon suggests flying to the mountains to watch fairies dancing in the moonlight, while the princess thinks they should just go to bed early. They are desperate to come to an amicable agreement, so they decide to leave this up to chance.\n\nThey take turns drawing a mouse from a bag which initially contains *w* white and *b* black mice. The person who is the first to draw a white mouse wins. After each mouse drawn by the dragon the rest of mice in the bag panic, and one of them jumps out of the bag itself (the princess draws her mice carefully and doesn't scare other mice). Princess draws first. What is the probability of the princess winning?\n\nIf there are no more mice in the bag and nobody has drawn a white mouse, the dragon wins. Mice which jump out of the bag themselves are not considered to be drawn (do not define the winner). Once a mouse has left the bag, it never returns to it. Every mouse is drawn from the bag with the same probability as every other one, and every mouse jumps out of the bag with the same probability as every other one.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe only line of input data contains two integers *w* and *b* (0<=\u2264<=*w*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=1000).\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput the probability of the princess winning.

Overall there are *n*<=-<=1 roads in the country. We know that if we don't take the direction of the roads into consideration, we can get from any city to any other one.\n\nThe council of the elders has recently decided to choose the capital of Treeland. Of course it should be a city of this country. The council is supposed to meet in the capital and regularly move from the capital to other cities (at this stage nobody is thinking about getting back to the capital from these cities). For that reason if city *a* is chosen a capital, then all roads must be oriented so that if we move along them, we can get from city *a* to any other city. For that some roads may have to be inversed.\n\nHelp the elders to choose the capital so that they have to inverse the minimum number of roads in the country.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of cities in Treeland.

He asked his students to implement the Posterization Image Filter.\n\nTheir algorithm will be tested on an array of integers, where the $i$-th integer represents the color of the $i$-th pixel in the image. The image is in black and white, therefore the color of each pixel will be an integer between 0 and 255 (inclusive).\n\nTo implement the filter, students are required to divide the black and white color range [0, 255] into groups of consecutive colors, and select one color in each group to be the group\u2019s key. In order to preserve image details, the size of a group must not be greater than $k$, and each color should belong to exactly one group.\n\nFinally, the students will replace the color of each pixel in the array with that color\u2019s assigned group key.\n\nTo better understand the effect, here is an image of a basking turtle where the Posterization Filter was applied with increasing $k$ to the right. \n\nTo make the process of checking the final answer easier, Professor Ibrahim wants students to divide the groups and assign the keys in a way that produces the lexicographically smallest possible array.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$, $1 \\leq k \\leq 256$), the number of pixels in the image, and the maximum size of a group, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$ ($0 \\leq p_i \\leq 255$), where $p_i$ is the color of the $i$-th pixel.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint $n$ space-separated integers; the lexicographically smallest possible array that represents the image after applying the Posterization filter.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 3\\n2 14 3 4\\n', '5 2\\n0 2 1 255 254\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0 12 3 3\\n', '0 1 1 254 254\\n']\n\nNote:\nOne possible way to group colors and assign keys for the first sample:\n\nColor $2$ belongs to the group $[0,2]$, with group key $0$.\n\nColor $14$ belongs to the group $[12,14]$, with group key $12$.\n\nColors $3$ and $4$ belong to group $[3, 5]$, with group key $3$.\n\nOther groups won't affect the result so they are not listed here.",

        "prompt": "Title: Xenia and Bit Operations\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nXenia the beginner programmer has a sequence *a*, consisting of 2*n* non-negative integers: *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a*2*n*. Xenia is currently studying bit operations. To better understand how they work, Xenia decided to calculate some value *v* for *a*.\n\nNamely, it takes several iterations to calculate value *v*. At the first iteration, Xenia writes a new sequence *a*1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2,<=*a*3\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*4,<=...,<=*a*2*n*<=-<=1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2*n*, consisting of 2*n*<=-<=1 elements. In other words, she writes down the bit-wise OR of adjacent elements of sequence *a*. At the second iteration, Xenia writes the bitwise exclusive OR of adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the first iteration. At the third iteration Xenia writes the bitwise OR of the adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the second iteration. And so on; the operations of bitwise exclusive OR and bitwise OR alternate. In the end, she obtains a sequence consisting of one element, and that element is *v*.\n\nLet's consider an example. Suppose that sequence *a*<==<=(1,<=2,<=3,<=4). Then let's write down all the transformations (1,<=2,<=3,<=4) <=\u2192<= (1\u00a0*or*\u00a02<==<=3,<=3\u00a0*or*\u00a04<==<=7) <=\u2192<= (3\u00a0*xor*\u00a07<==<=4). The result is *v*<==<=4.\n\nYou are given Xenia's initial sequence. But to calculate value *v* for a given sequence would be too easy, so you are given additional *m* queries. Each query is a pair of integers *p*,<=*b*. Query *p*,<=*b* means that you need to perform the assignment *a**p*<==<=*b*. After each query, you need to print the new value *v* for the new sequence *a*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=17,<=1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105). The next line contains 2*n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a*2*n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=&lt;<=230). Each of the next *m* lines contains queries. The *i*-th line contains integers *p**i*,<=*b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=2*n*,<=0<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=&lt;<=230) \u2014 the *i*-th query.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *m* integers \u2014 the *i*-th integer denotes value *v* for sequence *a* after the *i*-th query.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 4\\n1 6 3 5\\n1 4\\n3 4\\n1 2\\n1 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n']\n\nNote:\nFor more information on the bit operations, you can follow this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation",

        "prompt": "Title: Harry Potter and Three Spells\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nA long time ago (probably even in the first book), Nicholas Flamel, a great alchemist and the creator of the Philosopher's Stone, taught Harry Potter three useful spells. The first one allows you to convert *a* grams of sand into *b* grams of lead, the second one allows you to convert *c* grams of lead into *d* grams of gold and third one allows you to convert *e* grams of gold into *f* grams of sand. When Harry told his friends about these spells, Ron Weasley was amazed. After all, if they succeed in turning sand into lead, lead into gold, and then turning part of the gold into sand again and so on, then it will be possible to start with a small amount of sand and get huge amounts of gold! Even an infinite amount of gold! Hermione Granger, by contrast, was skeptical about that idea. She argues that according to the law of conservation of matter getting an infinite amount of matter, even using magic, is impossible. On the contrary, the amount of matter may even decrease during transformation, being converted to magical energy. Though Hermione's theory seems convincing, Ron won't believe her. As far as Ron is concerned, Hermione made up her law of conservation of matter to stop Harry and Ron wasting their time with this nonsense, and to make them go and do homework instead. That's why Ron has already collected a certain amount of sand for the experiments. A quarrel between the friends seems unavoidable...\n\nHelp Harry to determine which one of his friends is right, and avoid the quarrel after all. To do this you have to figure out whether it is possible to get the amount of gold greater than any preassigned number from some finite amount of sand.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains 6 integers *a*, *b*, *c*, *d*, *e*, *f* (0<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*,<=*d*,<=*e*,<=*f*<=\u2264<=1000).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint \"Ron\", if it is possible to get an infinitely large amount of gold having a certain finite amount of sand (and not having any gold and lead at all), i.e., Ron is right. Otherwise, print \"Hermione\".\n\nDemo Input:\n['100 200 250 150 200 250\\n', '100 50 50 200 200 100\\n', '100 10 200 20 300 30\\n', '0 0 0 0 0 0\\n', '1 1 0 1 1 1\\n', '1 0 1 2 1 2\\n', '100 1 100 1 0 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['Ron\\n', 'Hermione\\n', 'Hermione\\n', 'Hermione\\n', 'Ron\\n', 'Hermione\\n', 'Ron\\n']\n\nNote:\nConsider the first sample. Let's start with the 500 grams of sand. Apply the first spell 5 times and turn the sand into 1000 grams of lead. Then apply the second spell 4 times to get 600 grams of gold. Let\u2019s take 400 grams from the resulting amount of gold turn them back into sand. We get 500 grams of sand and 200 grams of gold. If we apply the same operations to 500 grams of sand again, we can get extra 200 grams of gold every time. Thus, you can get 200, 400, 600 etc. grams of gold, i.e., starting with a finite amount of sand (500 grams), you can get the amount of gold which is greater than any preassigned number.\n\nIn the forth sample it is impossible to get sand, or lead, or gold, applying the spells.\n\nIn the fifth sample an infinitely large amount of gold can be obtained by using only the second spell, which allows you to receive 1 gram of gold out of nothing. Note that if such a second spell is available, then the first and the third one do not affect the answer at all.\n\nThe seventh sample is more interesting. We can also start with a zero amount of sand there. With the aid of the third spell you can get sand out of nothing. We get 10000 grams of sand in this manner. Let's get 100 grams of lead using the first spell 100 times. Then make 1 gram of gold from them. We managed to receive 1 gram of gold, starting with a zero amount of sand!

        "prompt": "Title: Day at the Beach\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOne day Squidward, Spongebob and Patrick decided to go to the beach. Unfortunately, the weather was bad, so the friends were unable to ride waves. However, they decided to spent their time building sand castles.\n\nAt the end of the day there were *n* castles built by friends. Castles are numbered from 1 to *n*, and the height of the *i*-th castle is equal to *h**i*. When friends were about to leave, Squidward noticed, that castles are not ordered by their height, and this looks ugly. Now friends are going to reorder the castles in a way to obtain that condition *h**i*<=\u2264<=*h**i*<=+<=1 holds for all *i* from 1 to *n*<=-<=1.\n\nSquidward suggested the following process of sorting castles: \n -  Castles are split into blocks\u00a0\u2014 groups of consecutive castles. Therefore the block from *i* to *j* will include castles *i*,<=*i*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*j*. A block may consist of a single castle. -  The partitioning is chosen in such a way that every castle is a part of exactly one block. -  Each block is sorted independently from other blocks, that is the sequence *h**i*,<=*h**i*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*h**j* becomes sorted. -  The partitioning should satisfy the condition that after each block is sorted, the sequence *h**i* becomes sorted too. This may always be achieved by saying that the whole sequence is a single block. \nEven Patrick understands that increasing the number of blocks in partitioning will ease the sorting process. Now friends ask you to count the maximum possible number of blocks in a partitioning that satisfies all the above requirements.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of castles Spongebob, Patrick and Squidward made from sand during the day.\n\nThe next line contains *n* integers *h**i* (1<=\u2264<=*h**i*<=\u2264<=109). The *i*-th of these integers corresponds to the height of the *i*-th castle.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the maximum possible number of blocks in a valid partitioning.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n1 2 3\\n', '4\\n2 1 3 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n', '2\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample the partitioning looks like that: [1][2][3].\n\nIn the second sample the partitioning is: [2, 1][3, 2]",

The program contains two integer variables, *x* and *y*, and performs the following operations on a sequence *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* of positive integers:\n 1.  Initially, *x*<==<=1 and *y*<==<=0. If, after any step, *x*<=\u2264<=0 or *x*<=&gt;<=*n*, the program immediately terminates. 1.  The program increases both *x* and *y* by a value equal to *a**x* simultaneously. 1.  The program now increases *y* by *a**x* while decreasing *x* by *a**x*. 1.  The program executes steps 2 and 3 (first step 2, then step 3) repeatedly until it terminates (it may never terminate). So, the sequence of executed steps may start with: step 2, step 3, step 2, step 3, step 2 and so on. \nThe cows are not very good at arithmetic though, and they want to see how the program works.

        "prompt": "Title: Sum of Nestings\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nRecall that the bracket sequence is considered regular if it is possible to insert symbols '+' and '1' into it so that the result is a correct arithmetic expression. For example, a sequence \"(()())\" is regular, because we can get correct arithmetic expression insering symbols '+' and '1': \"((1+1)+(1+1))\". Also the following sequences are regular: \"()()()\", \"(())\" and \"()\". The following sequences are not regular bracket sequences: \")(\", \"(()\" and \"())(()\".\n\nIn this problem you are given two integers *n* and *k*. Your task is to construct a regular bracket sequence consisting of round brackets with length 2\u00b7*n* with total sum of nesting of all opening brackets equals to exactly *k*. The nesting of a single opening bracket equals to the number of pairs of brackets in which current opening bracket is embedded.\n\nFor example, in the sequence \"()(())\" the nesting of first opening bracket equals to 0, the nesting of the second opening bracket equals to 0 and the nesting of the third opening bracket equal to 1. So the total sum of nestings equals to 1.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=1018)\u00a0\u2014 the number of opening brackets and needed total nesting.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the required regular bracket sequence consisting of round brackets.\n\nIf there is no solution print \"Impossible\" (without quotes).\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 1\\n', '4 6\\n', '2 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['()(())', '(((())))', 'Impossible\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe first example is examined in the statement.\n\nIn the second example the answer is \"(((())))\". The nesting of the first opening bracket is 0, the nesting of the second is 1, the nesting of the third is 2, the nesting of fourth is 3. So the total sum of nestings equals to 0\u2009+\u20091\u2009+\u20092\u2009+\u20093\u2009=\u20096.\n\nIn the third it is impossible to construct a regular bracket sequence, because the maximum possible total sum of nestings for two opening brackets equals to 1. This total sum of nestings is obtained for the sequence \"(())\".",

His mother decided to leave him alone for *m* days and left on a vacation. She have prepared a lot of food, left some money and washed all Arseniy's clothes. \n\nTen minutes before her leave she realized that it would be also useful to prepare instruction of which particular clothes to wear on each of the days she will be absent. Arseniy's family is a bit weird so all the clothes is enumerated. For example, each of Arseniy's *n* socks is assigned a unique integer from 1 to *n*. Thus, the only thing his mother had to do was to write down two integers *l**i* and *r**i* for each of the days\u00a0\u2014 the indices of socks to wear on the day *i* (obviously, *l**i* stands for the left foot and *r**i* for the right). Each sock is painted in one of *k* colors.\n\nWhen mother already left Arseniy noticed that according to instruction he would wear the socks of different colors on some days. Of course, that is a terrible mistake cause by a rush. Arseniy is a smart boy, and, by some magical coincidence, he posses *k* jars with the paint\u00a0\u2014 one for each of *k* colors.\n\nArseniy wants to repaint some of the socks in such a way, that for each of *m* days he can follow the mother's instructions and wear the socks of the same color. As he is going to be very busy these days he will have no time to change the colors of any socks so he has to finalize the colors now.\n\nThe new computer game Bota-3 was just realised and Arseniy can't wait to play it. What is the minimum number of socks that need their color to be changed in order to make it possible to follow mother's instructions and wear the socks of the same color during each of *m* days.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains three integers *n*, *m* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000, 0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=200<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of socks, the number of days and the number of available colors respectively.\n\nThe second line contain *n* integers *c*1, *c*2, ..., *c**n* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*k*)\u00a0\u2014 current colors of Arseniy's socks.\n\nEach of the following *m* lines contains two integers *l**i* and *r**i* (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*,<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *l**i*<=\u2260<=*r**i*)\u00a0\u2014 indices of socks which Arseniy should wear during the *i*-th day.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of socks that should have their colors changed in order to be able to obey the instructions and not make people laugh from watching the socks of different colors.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 2 3\\n1 2 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n', '3 2 2\\n1 1 2\\n1 2\\n2 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, Arseniy can repaint the first and the third socks to the second color.\n\nIn the second sample, there is no need to change any colors.",

        "prompt": "Title: Animals\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 64 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOnce upon a time DravDe, an outstanding person famous for his professional achievements (as you must remember, he works in a warehouse storing Ogudar-Olok, a magical but non-alcoholic drink) came home after a hard day. That day he had to drink 9875 boxes of the drink and, having come home, he went to bed at once.\n\nDravDe dreamt about managing a successful farm. He dreamt that every day one animal came to him and asked him to let it settle there. However, DravDe, being unimaginably kind, could send the animal away and it went, rejected. There were exactly *n* days in DravDe\u2019s dream and the animal that came on the *i*-th day, ate exactly *c**i* tons of food daily starting from day *i*. But if one day the animal could not get the food it needed, it got really sad. At the very beginning of the dream there were exactly *X* tons of food on the farm.\n\nDravDe woke up terrified...\n\nWhen he retold the dream to you, he couldn\u2019t remember how many animals were on the farm by the end of the *n*-th day any more, but he did remember that nobody got sad (as it was a happy farm) and that there was the maximum possible amount of the animals. That\u2019s the number he wants you to find out. \n\nIt should be noticed that the animals arrived in the morning and DravDe only started to feed them in the afternoon, so that if an animal willing to join them is rejected, it can\u2019t eat any farm food. But if the animal does join the farm, it eats daily from that day to the *n*-th.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains integers *n* and *X* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*X*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 amount of days in DravDe\u2019s dream and the total amount of food (in tons) that was there initially. The second line contains integers *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=300). Numbers in the second line are divided by a space.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput the only number \u2014 the maximum possible amount of animals on the farm by the end of the *n*-th day given that the food was enough for everybody.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 4\\n1 1 1\\n', '3 6\\n1 1 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '3\\n']\n\nNote:\nNote to the first example: DravDe leaves the second and the third animal on the farm. The second animal will eat one ton of food on the second day and one ton on the third day. The third animal will eat one ton of food on the third day.",

A certain number of points is given for destroying each figure depending on the figure type and the current factor value. \n\nThere are *n* types of geometric figures. The number of figures of type *k**i* and figure cost *c**i* is known for each figure type. A player gets *c**i*\u00b7*f*  points for destroying one figure of type *i*, where *f* is the current factor. The factor value can be an integer number from 1 to *t*<=+<=1, inclusive. At the beginning of the game the factor value is equal to 1. The factor is set to *i*<=+<=1 after destruction of *p**i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*t*) figures, so the (*p**i*<=+<=1)-th figure to be destroyed is considered with factor equal to *i*<=+<=1.\n\nYour task is to determine the maximum number of points Vasya can get after he destroys all figures. Take into account that Vasya is so tough that he can destroy figures in any order chosen by him.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains the only integer number *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of figure types.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains two integer numbers *k**i* and *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*k**i*<=\u2264<=109,<=0<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=1000), separated with space \u2014 the number of figures of the *i*-th type and the cost of one *i*-type figure, correspondingly.\n\nThe next line contains the only integer number *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number that describe the factor's changes. \n\nThe next line contains *t* integer numbers *p**i* (1<=\u2264<=*p*1<=&lt;<=*p*2<=&lt;<=...<=&lt;<=*p**t*<=\u2264<=1012), separated with spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++.

        "prompt": "Title: Space Voyage\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe Smart Beaver from ABBYY plans a space travel on an ultramodern spaceship. During the voyage he plans to visit *n* planets. For planet *i* *a**i* is the maximum number of suitcases that an alien tourist is allowed to bring to the planet, and *b**i* is the number of citizens on the planet.\n\nThe Smart Beaver is going to bring some presents from ABBYY to the planets he will be visiting. The presents are packed in suitcases, *x* presents in each. The Beaver will take to the ship exactly *a*1<=+<=...<=+<=*a**n* suitcases.\n\nAs the Beaver lands on the *i*-th planet, he takes *a**i* suitcases and goes out. On the first day on the planet the Beaver takes a walk and gets to know the citizens. On the second and all subsequent days the Beaver gives presents to the citizens \u2014 each of the *b**i* citizens gets one present per day. The Beaver leaves the planet in the evening of the day when the number of presents left is strictly less than the number of citizens (i.e. as soon as he won't be able to give away the proper number of presents the next day). He leaves the remaining presents at the hotel.\n\nThe Beaver is going to spend exactly *c* days traveling. The time spent on flights between the planets is considered to be zero. In how many ways can one choose the positive integer *x* so that the planned voyage will take exactly *c* days?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains space-separated integers *n* and *c* \u2014 the number of planets that the Beaver is going to visit and the number of days he is going to spend traveling, correspondingly.\n\nThe next *n* lines contain pairs of space-separated integers *a**i*,<=*b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of suitcases he can bring to the *i*-th planet and the number of citizens of the *i*-th planet, correspondingly.\n\nThe input limitations for getting 30 points are: \n -  1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100 -  1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100 -  1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=100 -  1<=\u2264<=*c*<=\u2264<=100 \nThe input limitations for getting 100 points are: \n -  1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=104 -  0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109 -  1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=109 -  1<=\u2264<=*c*<=\u2264<=109 \nDue to possible overflow, it is recommended to use the 64-bit arithmetic. In some solutions even the 64-bit arithmetic can overflow. So be careful in calculations!\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number *k* \u2014 the number of ways to choose *x* so as to travel for exactly *c* days. If there are infinitely many possible values of *x*, print -1.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 5\\n1 5\\n2 4\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example there is only one suitable value *x*\u2009=\u20095. Then the Beaver takes 1 suitcase with 5 presents to the first planet. Here he spends 2 days: he hangs around on the first day, and he gives away five presents on the second day. He takes 2 suitcases with 10 presents to the second planet. Here he spends 3 days \u2014 he gives away 4 presents on the second and the third days and leaves the remaining 2 presents at the hotel. In total, the Beaver spends 5 days traveling.\n\nFor *x*\u2009=\u20094 or less the Beaver won't have enough presents for the second day on the first planet, so the voyage will end too soon. For *x*\u2009=\u20096 and more the Beaver will spend at least one more day on the second planet, and the voyage will take too long.",

For each news he also creates a list of hashtags to make searching for a particular topic more comfortable. For the purpose of this problem we define hashtag as a string consisting of lowercase English letters and exactly one symbol '#' located at the beginning of the string. The length of the hashtag is defined as the number of symbols in it without the symbol '#'.\n\nThe head administrator of the page told Vasya that hashtags should go in lexicographical order (take a look at the notes section for the definition).\n\nVasya is lazy so he doesn't want to actually change the order of hashtags in already published news. Instead, he decided to delete some suffixes (consecutive characters at the end of the string) of some of the hashtags. He is allowed to delete any number of characters, even the whole string except for the symbol '#'. Vasya wants to pick such a way to delete suffixes that the total number of deleted symbols is minimum possible. If there are several optimal solutions, he is fine with any of them.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=500<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of hashtags being edited now.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains exactly one hashtag of positive length.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of all hashtags (i.e. the total length of the string except for characters '#') won't exceed 500<=000.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the resulting hashtags in any of the optimal solutions.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n#book\\n#bigtown\\n#big\\n', '3\\n#book\\n#cool\\n#cold\\n', '4\\n#car\\n#cart\\n#art\\n#at\\n', '3\\n#apple\\n#apple\\n#fruit\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['#b\\n#big\\n#big\\n', '#book\\n#co\\n#cold\\n', '#\\n#\\n#art\\n#at\\n', '#apple\\n#apple\\n#fruit\\n']\n\nNote:\nWord *a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>,\u2009*a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>,\u2009...,\u2009*a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*m*</sub> of length *m* is lexicographically not greater than word *b*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>,\u2009*b*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>,\u2009...,\u2009*b*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*k*</sub> of length *k*, if one of two conditions hold: \n -  at first position *i*, such that *a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub>\u2009\u2260\u2009*b*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub>, the character *a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub> goes earlier in the alphabet than character *b*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub>, i.e. *a* has smaller character than *b* in the first position where they differ; -  if there is no such position *i* and *m*\u2009\u2264\u2009*k*, i.e. the first word is a prefix of the second or two words are equal. \nThe sequence of words is said to be sorted in lexicographical order if each word (except the last one) is lexicographically not greater than the next word.\n\nFor the words consisting of lowercase English letters the lexicographical order coincides with the alphabet word order in the dictionary.\n\nAccording to the above definition, if a hashtag consisting of one character '#' it is lexicographically not greater than any other valid hashtag. That's why in the third sample we can't keep first two hashtags unchanged and shorten the other two.",

He knows for sure that exactly one of them committed the crime. To find out which one did it, the detective lines up the suspects and numbered them from 1 to *n*. After that, he asked each one: \"Which one committed the crime?\". Suspect number *i* answered either \"The crime was committed by suspect number *a**i*\", or \"Suspect number *a**i* didn't commit the crime\". Also, the suspect could say so about himself (*a**i*<==<=*i*).\n\nSherlock Holmes understood for sure that exactly *m* answers were the truth and all other answers were a lie.

        "prompt": "Title: Magic Box\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOne day Vasya was going home when he saw a box lying on the road. The box can be represented as a rectangular parallelepiped. Vasya needed no time to realize that the box is special, as all its edges are parallel to the coordinate axes, one of its vertices is at point (0,<=0,<=0), and the opposite one is at point (*x*1,<=*y*1,<=*z*1). The six faces of the box contain some numbers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a*6, exactly one number right in the center of each face.\n\nThe numbers are located on the box like that: \n -  number *a*1 is written on the face that lies on the ZOX plane; -  *a*2 is written on the face, parallel to the plane from the previous point; -  *a*3 is written on the face that lies on the XOY plane; -  *a*4 is written on the face, parallel to the plane from the previous point; -  *a*5 is written on the face that lies on the YOZ plane; -  *a*6 is written on the face, parallel to the plane from the previous point. \nAt the moment Vasya is looking at the box from point (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*). Find the sum of numbers that Vasya sees. Note that all faces of the box are not transparent and Vasya can't see the numbers through the box. The picture contains transparent faces just to make it easier to perceive. You can consider that if Vasya is looking from point, lying on the plane of some face, than he can not see the number that is written on this face. It is enough to see the center of a face to see the corresponding number for Vasya. Also note that Vasya always reads correctly the *a**i* numbers that he sees, independently of their rotation, angle and other factors (that is, for example, if Vasya sees some *a**i*<==<=6, then he can't mistake this number for 9 and so on).\n\nInput Specification:\nThe fist input line contains three space-separated integers *x*, *y* and *z* (|*x*|,<=|*y*|,<=|*z*|<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 the coordinates of Vasya's position in space. The second line contains three space-separated integers *x*1, *y*1, *z*1 (1<=\u2264<=*x*1,<=*y*1,<=*z*1<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 the coordinates of the box's vertex that is opposite to the vertex at point (0,<=0,<=0). The third line contains six space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a*6 (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 the numbers that are written on the box faces. \n\nIt is guaranteed that point (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*) is located strictly outside the box.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the sum of all numbers on the box faces that Vasya sees.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 2 2\\n1 1 1\\n1 2 3 4 5 6\\n', '0 0 10\\n3 2 3\\n1 2 3 4 5 6\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['12\\n', '4\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe first sample corresponds to perspective, depicted on the picture. Vasya sees numbers *a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub> (on the top face that is the darkest), *a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">6</sub> (on the right face that is the lightest) and *a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">4</sub> (on the left visible face).\n\nIn the second sample Vasya can only see number *a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">4</sub>.",

        "prompt": "Title: Programming Language\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nRecently, Valery have come across an entirely new programming language. Most of all the language attracted him with template functions and procedures. Let us remind you that templates are tools of a language, designed to encode generic algorithms, without reference to some parameters (e.g., data types, buffer sizes, default values).\n\nValery decided to examine template procedures in this language in more detail. The description of a template procedure consists of the procedure name and the list of its parameter types. The generic type T parameters can be used as parameters of template procedures.\n\nA procedure call consists of a procedure name and a list of variable parameters. Let's call a procedure suitable for this call if the following conditions are fulfilled: \n -  its name equals to the name of the called procedure; -  the number of its parameters equals to the number of parameters of the procedure call; -  the types of variables in the procedure call match the corresponding types of its parameters. The variable type matches the type of a parameter if the parameter has a generic type T or the type of the variable and the parameter are the same. \nYou are given a description of some set of template procedures. You are also given a list of variables used in the program, as well as direct procedure calls that use the described variables. For each call you need to count the number of procedures that are suitable for this call.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number of template procedures. The next *n* lines contain the description of the procedures specified in the following format:\n\n\"void procedureName (type_1, type_2, ..., type_t)\" (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=5), where void is the keyword, procedureName is the procedure name, type_i is the type of the next parameter. Types of language parameters can be \"int\", \"string\", \"double\", and the keyword \"T\", which denotes the generic type.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number of used variables. Next *m* lines specify the description of the variables in the following format:\n\n\"type variableName\", where type is the type of variable that can take values \"int\", \"string\", \"double\", variableName \u2014 the name of the variable.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number of procedure calls. Next *k* lines specify the procedure calls in the following format:\n\n\"procedureName (var_1, var_2, ..., var_t)\" (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=5), where procedureName is the name of the procedure, var_i is the name of a variable.\n\nThe lines describing the variables, template procedures and their calls may contain spaces at the beginning of the line and at the end of the line, before and after the brackets and commas. Spaces may be before and after keyword void. The length of each input line does not exceed 100 characters. The names of variables and procedures are non-empty strings of lowercase English letters and numbers with lengths of not more than 10 characters. Note that this is the only condition at the names. Only the specified variables are used in procedure calls. The names of the variables are distinct. No two procedures are the same. Two procedures are the same, if they have identical names and identical ordered sets of types of their parameters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOn each of *k* lines print a single number, where the *i*-th number stands for the number of suitable template procedures for the *i*-th call.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\nvoid f(int,T)\\nvoid  f(T, T)\\n void foo123   ( int,  double,  string,string  ) \\n  void  p(T,double)\\n3\\nint a\\n string    s\\ndouble x123 \\n5\\nf(a,  a)\\n  f(s,a   )\\nfoo   (a,s,s)\\n f  (  s  ,x123)\\nproc(a)\\n', '6\\nvoid f(string,double,int)\\nvoid f(int)\\n   void f  ( T  )\\nvoid procedure(int,double)\\nvoid f  (T, double,int)   \\nvoid f(string, T,T)\\n4\\n int a\\n int x\\nstring  t\\ndouble  val  \\n5\\nf(t, a, a)\\nf(t,val,a)\\nf(val,a, val)\\n solve300(val, val)\\nf  (x)\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n', '1\\n3\\n0\\n0\\n2\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

Find the number of distinct pairs of the vertices which have a distance of exactly *k* between them. Note that pairs (*v*, *u*) and (*u*, *v*) are considered to be the same pair.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=500) \u2014 the number of vertices and the required distance between the vertices.\n\nNext *n*<=-<=1 lines describe the edges as \"*a**i* *b**i*\" (without the quotes) (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *a**i*<=\u2260<=*b**i*), where *a**i* and *b**i* are the vertices connected by the *i*-th edge.

Find for Mehrdad the maximum possible total beauty of Hoses he can invite so that no one gets hurt and the total weight doesn't exceed *w*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integers *n*, *m* and *w* (1<=<=\u2264<=<=*n*<=<=\u2264<=<=1000, , 1<=\u2264<=*w*<=\u2264<=1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of Hoses, the number of pair of friends and the maximum total weight of those who are invited.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *w*1,<=*w*2,<=...,<=*w**n* (1<=\u2264<=*w**i*<=\u2264<=1000)\u00a0\u2014 the weights of the Hoses.\n\nThe third line contains *n* integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=106)\u00a0\u2014 the beauties of the Hoses.\n\nThe next *m* lines contain pairs of friends, the *i*-th of them contains two integers *x**i* and *y**i* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *x**i*<=\u2260<=*y**i*), meaning that Hoses *x**i* and *y**i* are friends. Note that friendship is bidirectional. All pairs (*x**i*,<=*y**i*) are distinct.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the maximum possible total beauty of Hoses Mehrdad can invite so that no one gets hurt and the total weight doesn't exceed *w*.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 1 5\\n3 2 5\\n2 4 2\\n1 2\\n', '4 2 11\\n2 4 6 6\\n6 4 2 1\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['6\\n', '7\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample there are two friendship groups: Hoses {1,\u20092} and Hos {3}. The best way is to choose all of Hoses in the first group, sum of their weights is equal to 5 and sum of their beauty is 6.\n\nIn the second sample there are two friendship groups: Hoses {1,\u20092,\u20093} and Hos {4}. Mehrdad can't invite all the Hoses from the first group because their total weight is 12\u2009&gt;\u200911, thus the best way is to choose the first Hos from the first group and the only one from the second group. The total weight will be 8, and the total beauty will be 7.",

        "prompt": "Title: School Marks\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nLittle Vova studies programming in an elite school. Vova and his classmates are supposed to write *n* progress tests, for each test they will get a mark from 1 to *p*. Vova is very smart and he can write every test for any mark, but he doesn't want to stand out from the crowd too much. If the sum of his marks for all tests exceeds value *x*, then his classmates notice how smart he is and start distracting him asking to let them copy his homework. And if the median of his marks will be lower than *y* points (the definition of a median is given in the notes), then his mom will decide that he gets too many bad marks and forbid him to play computer games.\n\nVova has already wrote *k* tests and got marks *a*1,<=...,<=*a**k*. He doesn't want to get into the first or the second situation described above and now he needs to determine which marks he needs to get for the remaining tests. Help him do that.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains 5 space-separated integers: *n*, *k*, *p*, *x* and *y* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=999, *n* is odd, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=&lt;<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*p*<=\u2264<=1000, *n*<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*\u00b7*p*, 1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*p*). Here *n* is the number of tests that Vova is planned to write, *k* is the number of tests he has already written, *p* is the maximum possible mark for a test, *x* is the maximum total number of points so that the classmates don't yet disturb Vova, *y* is the minimum median point so that mom still lets him play computer games.\n\nThe second line contains *k* space-separated integers: *a*1,<=...,<=*a**k* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*p*)\u00a0\u2014 the marks that Vova got for the tests he has already written.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf Vova cannot achieve the desired result, print \"-1\".\n\nOtherwise, print *n*<=-<=*k* space-separated integers\u00a0\u2014 the marks that Vova should get for the remaining tests. If there are multiple possible solutions, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 3 5 18 4\\n3 5 4\\n', '5 3 5 16 4\\n5 5 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4 1\\n', '-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe median of sequence *a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>,\u00a0...,\u00a0*a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*n*</sub> where *n* is odd (in this problem *n* is always odd) is the element staying on (*n*\u2009+\u20091)\u2009/\u20092 position in the sorted list of *a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub>.\n\nIn the first sample the sum of marks equals 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 17, what doesn't exceed 18, that means that Vova won't be disturbed by his classmates. And the median point of the sequence {1, 3, 4, 4, 5} equals to 4, that isn't less than 4, so his mom lets him play computer games.\n\nPlease note that you do not have to maximize the sum of marks or the median mark. Any of the answers: \"4\u00a02\", \"2\u00a04\", \"5\u00a01\", \"1\u00a05\", \"4\u00a01\", \"1\u00a04\" for the first test is correct.\n\nIn the second sample Vova got three '5' marks, so even if he gets two '1' marks, the sum of marks will be 17, that is more than the required value of 16. So, the answer to this test is \"-1\".",

The array *a* is given to Devu and *b* to his brother. \n\nAs Devu is really a naughty kid, he wants the minimum value of his array *a* should be at least as much as the maximum value of his brother's array *b*. \n\nNow you have to help Devu in achieving this condition. You can perform multiple operations on the arrays. In a single operation, you are allowed to decrease or increase any element of any of the arrays by 1. Note that you are allowed to apply the operation on any index of the array multiple times.\n\nYou need to find minimum number of operations required to satisfy Devu's condition so that the brothers can play peacefully without fighting.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers *n*, *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105).

Now array *a* will be [3; 3] and array *b* will also be [3; 3]. Here minimum element of *a* is at least as large as maximum element of *b*. So minimum number of operations needed to satisfy Devu's condition are 3.\n\nIn example 3, you don't need to do any operation, Devu's condition is already satisfied.",

        "prompt": "Title: Game\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nFurik and Rubik love playing computer games. Furik has recently found a new game that greatly interested Rubik. The game consists of *n* parts and to complete each part a player may probably need to complete some other ones. We know that the game can be fully completed, that is, its parts do not form cyclic dependencies. \n\nRubik has 3 computers, on which he can play this game. All computers are located in different houses. Besides, it has turned out that each part of the game can be completed only on one of these computers. Let's number the computers with integers from 1 to 3. Rubik can perform the following actions: \n -  Complete some part of the game on some computer. Rubik spends exactly 1 hour on completing any part on any computer. -  Move from the 1-st computer to the 2-nd one. Rubik spends exactly 1 hour on that. -  Move from the 1-st computer to the 3-rd one. Rubik spends exactly 2 hours on that. -  Move from the 2-nd computer to the 1-st one. Rubik spends exactly 2 hours on that. -  Move from the 2-nd computer to the 3-rd one. Rubik spends exactly 1 hour on that. -  Move from the 3-rd computer to the 1-st one. Rubik spends exactly 1 hour on that. -  Move from the 3-rd computer to the 2-nd one. Rubik spends exactly 2 hours on that. \nHelp Rubik to find the minimum number of hours he will need to complete all parts of the game. Initially Rubik can be located at the computer he considers necessary.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200) \u2014 the number of game parts. The next line contains *n* integers, the *i*-th integer \u2014 *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=3) represents the number of the computer, on which you can complete the game part number *i*. \n\nNext *n* lines contain descriptions of game parts. The *i*-th line first contains integer *k**i* (0<=\u2264<=*k**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1), then *k**i* distinct integers *a**i*,<=*j* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*;\u00a0*a**i*,<=*j*<=\u2260<=*i*) \u2014 the numbers of parts to complete before part *i*.\n\nNumbers on all lines are separated by single spaces. You can assume that the parts of the game are numbered from 1 to *n* in some way. It is guaranteed that there are no cyclic dependencies between the parts of the game.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOn a single line print the answer to the problem.\n\nDemo Input:\n['1\\n1\\n0\\n', '5\\n2 2 1 1 3\\n1 5\\n2 5 1\\n2 5 4\\n1 5\\n0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '7\\n']\n\nNote:\nNote to the second sample: before the beginning of the game the best strategy is to stand by the third computer. First we complete part 5. Then we go to the 1-st computer and complete parts 3 and 4. Then we go to the 2-nd computer and complete parts 1 and 2. In total we get 1+1+2+1+2, which equals 7 hours.",

        "prompt": "Title: Weird Chess\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIgor has been into chess for a long time and now he is sick of the game by the ordinary rules. He is going to think of new rules of the game and become world famous.\n\nIgor's chessboard is a square of size *n*<=\u00d7<=*n* cells. Igor decided that simple rules guarantee success, that's why his game will have only one type of pieces. Besides, all pieces in his game are of the same color. The possible moves of a piece are described by a set of shift vectors. The next passage contains a formal description of available moves.\n\nLet the rows of the board be numbered from top to bottom and the columns be numbered from left to right from 1 to *n*. Let's assign to each square a pair of integers (*x*,<=*y*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the corresponding column and row. Each of the possible moves of the piece is defined by a pair of integers (*dx*,<=*dy*); using this move, the piece moves from the field (*x*,<=*y*) to the field (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). You can perform the move if the cell (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*) is within the boundaries of the board and doesn't contain another piece. Pieces that stand on the cells other than (*x*,<=*y*) and (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*) are not important when considering the possibility of making the given move (for example, like when a knight moves in usual chess).\n\nIgor offers you to find out what moves his chess piece can make. He placed several pieces on the board and for each unoccupied square he told you whether it is attacked by any present piece (i.e. whether some of the pieces on the field can move to that cell). Restore a possible set of shift vectors of the piece, or else determine that Igor has made a mistake and such situation is impossible for any set of shift vectors.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50).\n\nThe next *n* lines contain *n* characters each describing the position offered by Igor. The *j*-th character of the *i*-th string can have the following values:\n-  o \u2014 in this case the field (*i*,<=*j*) is occupied by a piece and the field may or may not be attacked by some other piece;-  x \u2014 in this case field (*i*,<=*j*) is attacked by some piece;-  . \u2014 in this case field (*i*,<=*j*) isn't attacked by any piece.\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one piece on the board.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf there is a valid set of moves, in the first line print a single word 'YES' (without the quotes). Next, print the description of the set of moves of a piece in the form of a (2*n*<=-<=1)<=\u00d7<=(2*n*<=-<=1) board, the center of the board has a piece and symbols 'x' mark cells that are attacked by it, in a format similar to the input. See examples of the output for a full understanding of the format. If there are several possible answers, print any of them.\n\nIf a valid set of moves does not exist, print a single word 'NO'.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5\\noxxxx\\nx...x\\nx...x\\nx...x\\nxxxxo\\n', '6\\n.x.x..\\nx.x.x.\\n.xo..x\\nx..ox.\\n.x.x.x\\n..x.x.\\n', '3\\no.x\\noxx\\no.x\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n....x....\\n....x....\\n....x....\\n....x....\\nxxxxoxxxx\\n....x....\\n....x....\\n....x....\\n....x....\\n', 'YES\\n...........\\n...........\\n...........\\n....x.x....\\n...x...x...\\n.....o.....\\n...x...x...\\n....x.x....\\n...........\\n...........\\n...........\\n', 'NO\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample test the piece is a usual chess rook, and in the second sample test the piece is a usual chess knight.",

        "prompt": "Title: Contest Balloons\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOne tradition of ACM-ICPC contests is that a team gets a balloon for every solved problem. We assume that the submission time doesn't matter and teams are sorted only by the number of balloons they have. It means that one's place is equal to the number of teams with more balloons, increased by 1. For example, if there are seven teams with more balloons, you get the eight place. Ties are allowed.\n\nYou should know that it's important to eat before a contest. If the number of balloons of a team is greater than the weight of this team, the team starts to float in the air together with their workstation. They eventually touch the ceiling, what is strictly forbidden by the rules. The team is then disqualified and isn't considered in the standings.\n\nA contest has just finished. There are *n* teams, numbered 1 through *n*. The *i*-th team has *t**i* balloons and weight *w**i*. It's guaranteed that *t**i* doesn't exceed *w**i* so nobody floats initially.\n\nLimak is a member of the first team. He doesn't like cheating and he would never steal balloons from other teams. Instead, he can give his balloons away to other teams, possibly making them float. Limak can give away zero or more balloons of his team. Obviously, he can't give away more balloons than his team initially has.\n\nWhat is the best place Limak can get?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the standard input contains one integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=300<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of teams.\n\nThe *i*-th of *n* following lines contains two integers *t**i* and *w**i* (0<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=*w**i*<=\u2264<=1018)\u00a0\u2014 respectively the number of balloons and the weight of the *i*-th team. Limak is a member of the first team.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint one integer denoting the best place Limak can get.\n\nDemo Input:\n['8\\n20 1000\\n32 37\\n40 1000\\n45 50\\n16 16\\n16 16\\n14 1000\\n2 1000\\n', '7\\n4 4\\n4 4\\n4 4\\n4 4\\n4 4\\n4 4\\n5 5\\n', '7\\n14000000003 1000000000000000000\\n81000000000 88000000000\\n5000000000 7000000000\\n15000000000 39000000000\\n46000000000 51000000000\\n0 1000000000\\n0 0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n', '2\\n', '2\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, Limak has 20 balloons initially. There are three teams with more balloons (32, 40 and 45 balloons), so Limak has the fourth place initially. One optimal strategy is:\n1.  Limak gives 6 balloons away to a team with 32 balloons and weight 37, which is just enough to make them fly. Unfortunately, Limak has only 14 balloons now and he would get the fifth place.1.  Limak gives 6 balloons away to a team with 45 balloons. Now they have 51 balloons and weight 50 so they fly and get disqualified.1.  Limak gives 1 balloon to each of two teams with 16 balloons initially.1.  Limak has 20\u2009-\u20096\u2009-\u20096\u2009-\u20091\u2009-\u20091\u2009=\u20096 balloons.1.  There are three other teams left and their numbers of balloons are 40, 14 and 2.1.  Limak gets the third place because there are two teams with more balloons. \nIn the second sample, Limak has the second place and he can't improve it.\n\nIn the third sample, Limak has just enough balloons to get rid of teams 2, 3 and 5 (the teams with 81\u2009000\u2009000\u2009000, 5\u2009000\u2009000\u2009000 and 46\u2009000\u2009000\u2009000 balloons respectively). With zero balloons left, he will get the second place (ex-aequo with team 6 and team 7).",

Christmas is coming, so sponsors decided to decorate the Christmas tree with their prizes. \n\nThey took *n* prizes for the contestants and wrote on each of them a unique id (integer from 1 to *n*). A gift *i* is characterized by integer *a**i*\u00a0\u2014 pleasantness of the gift. The pleasantness of the gift can be positive, negative or zero. Sponsors placed the gift 1 on the top of the tree. All the other gifts hung on a rope tied to some other gift so that each gift hung on the first gift, possibly with a sequence of ropes and another gifts. Formally, the gifts formed a rooted tree with *n* vertices.\n\nThe prize-giving procedure goes in the following way: the participants come to the tree one after another, choose any of the remaining gifts and cut the rope this prize hang on. Note that all the ropes which were used to hang other prizes on the chosen one are not cut. So the contestant gets the chosen gift as well as the all the gifts that hang on it, possibly with a sequence of ropes and another gifts.\n\nOur friends, Chloe and Vladik, shared the first place on the olympiad and they will choose prizes at the same time! To keep themselves from fighting, they decided to choose two different gifts so that the sets of the gifts that hang on them with a sequence of ropes and another gifts don't intersect. In other words, there shouldn't be any gift that hang both on the gift chosen by Chloe and on the gift chosen by Vladik. From all of the possible variants they will choose such pair of prizes that the sum of pleasantness of all the gifts that they will take after cutting the ropes is as large as possible.\n\nPrint the maximum sum of pleasantness that Vladik and Chloe can get.

        "prompt": "Title: Vasya and Types\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nProgrammer Vasya is studying a new programming language &amp;K*. The &amp;K* language resembles the languages of the C family in its syntax. However, it is more powerful, which is why the rules of the actual C-like languages are unapplicable to it. To fully understand the statement, please read the language's description below carefully and follow it and not the similar rules in real programming languages.\n\nThere is a very powerful system of pointers on &amp;K* \u2014 you can add an asterisk to the right of the existing type *X* \u2014 that will result in new type *X*<=*<=. That is called pointer-definition operation. Also, there is the operation that does the opposite \u2014 to any type of *X*, which is a pointer, you can add an ampersand \u2014 that will result in a type &amp;*X*, to which refers *X*. That is called a dereference operation.\n\nThe &amp;K* language has only two basic data types \u2014 void and errtype. Also, the language has operators typedef and typeof.\n-  The operator \"typedef *A* *B*\" defines a new data type *B*, which is equivalent to *A*. *A* can have asterisks and ampersands, and *B* cannot have them. For example, the operator typedef void** ptptvoid will create a new type ptptvoid, that can be used as void**.-  The operator \"typeof *A*\" returns type of *A*, brought to void, that is, returns the type void**...*, equivalent to it with the necessary number of asterisks (the number can possibly be zero). That is, having defined the ptptvoid type, as shown above, the typeof ptptvoid operator will return void**.\nAn attempt of dereferencing of the void type will lead to an error: to a special data type errtype. For errtype the following equation holds true: errtype*<==<=&amp;errtype<==<=errtype. An attempt to use the data type that hasn't been defined before that will also lead to the errtype.\n\nUsing typedef, we can define one type several times. Of all the definitions only the last one is valid. However, all the types that have been defined earlier using this type do not change.\n\nLet us also note that the dereference operation has the lower priority that the pointer operation, in other words &amp;*T*<=*<= is always equal to *T*.\n\nNote, that the operators are executed consecutively one by one. If we have two operators \"typedef &amp;void a\" and \"typedef a* b\", then at first a becomes errtype, and after that b becomes errtype* = errtype, but not &amp;void* = void (see sample 2).\n\nVasya does not yet fully understand this powerful technology, that's why he asked you to help him. Write a program that analyzes these operators.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of operators. Then follow *n* lines with operators. Each operator is of one of two types: either \"typedef *A* *B*\", or \"typeof *A*\". In the first case the *B* type differs from void and errtype types, and besides, doesn't have any asterisks and ampersands.\n\nAll the data type names are non-empty lines of no more than 20 lowercase Latin letters. The number of asterisks and ampersands separately in one type in any operator does not exceed 10, however if we bring some types to void with several asterisks, their number may exceed 10.\n\nOutput Specification:\nFor every typeof operator print on the single line the answer to that operator \u2014 the type that the given operator returned.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5\\ntypedef void* ptv\\ntypeof ptv\\ntypedef &amp;&amp;ptv node\\ntypeof node\\ntypeof &amp;ptv\\n', '17\\ntypedef void* b\\ntypedef b* c\\ntypeof b\\ntypeof c\\ntypedef &amp;b b\\ntypeof b\\ntypeof c\\ntypedef &amp;&amp;b* c\\ntypeof c\\ntypedef &amp;b* c\\ntypeof c\\ntypedef &amp;void b\\ntypeof b\\ntypedef b******* c\\ntypeof c\\ntypedef &amp;&amp;b* c\\ntypeof c\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['void*\\nerrtype\\nvoid\\n', 'void*\\nvoid**\\nvoid\\nvoid**\\nerrtype\\nvoid\\nerrtype\\nerrtype\\nerrtype\\n']\n\nNote:\nLet's look at the second sample.\n\nAfter the first two queries typedef the b type is equivalent to void*, and \u0441 \u2014 to void**.\n\nThe next query typedef redefines b \u2014 it is now equal to &amp;b = &amp;void* = void. At that, the \u0441 type doesn't change.\n\nAfter that the \u0441 type is defined as &amp;&amp;b* = &amp;&amp;void* = &amp;void = errtype. It doesn't influence the b type, that's why the next typedef defines c as &amp;void* = void.\n\nThen the b type is again redefined as &amp;void = errtype. \n\nPlease note that the c type in the next query is defined exactly as errtype******* = errtype, and not &amp;void******* = void******. The same happens in the last typedef.",

A person can pass through a point with a key without taking it.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *k* and *p* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1<=000, *n*<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=2<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*p*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the number of people, the number of keys and the office location.\n\nThe second line contains *n* distinct integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 positions in which people are located initially. The positions are given in arbitrary order.\n\nThe third line contains *k* distinct integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**k* (1<=\u2264<=*b**j*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 positions of the keys. The positions are given in arbitrary order.\n\nNote that there can't be more than one person or more than one key in the same point. A person and a key can be located in the same point.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the minimum time (in seconds) needed for all *n* to reach the office with keys.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 4 50\\n20 100\\n60 10 40 80\\n', '1 2 10\\n11\\n15 7\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['50\\n', '7\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example the person located at point 20 should take the key located at point 40 and go with it to the office located at point 50. He spends 30 seconds. The person located at point 100 can take the key located at point 80 and go to the office with it. He spends 50 seconds. Thus, after 50 seconds everybody is in office with keys.",

Each ship looks as a 1<=\u00d7<=*a* rectangle (that is, it occupies a sequence of *a* consecutive squares of the field). The ships cannot intersect and even touch each other.\n\nAfter that Bob makes a sequence of \"shots\".

        "prompt": "Title: Wizards and Minimal Spell\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nLet's dive into one of the most interesting areas of magic \u2014 writing spells. Learning this exciting but challenging science is very troublesome, so now you will not learn the magic words, but only get to know the basic rules of writing spells.\n\nEach spell consists of several lines. The line, whose first non-space character is character \"#\" is an amplifying line and it is responsible for spell power. The remaining lines are common, and determine the effect of the spell.\n\nYou came across the text of some spell. Spell was too long, so you cannot understand its meaning. So you want to make it as short as possible without changing the meaning.\n\nThe only way to shorten a spell that you know is the removal of some spaces and line breaks. We know that when it comes to texts of spells, the spaces carry meaning only in the amplifying lines, so we should remove all spaces in other lines. Newlines also do not matter, unless any of the two separated lines is amplifying. Thus, if two consecutive lines are not amplifying, they need to be joined into one (i.e. we should concatenate the second line to the first one). Removing spaces in amplifying lines and concatenating the amplifying lines to anything is forbidden.\n\nNote that empty lines must be processed just like all the others: they must be joined to the adjacent non-amplifying lines, or preserved in the output, if they are surrounded with amplifying lines on both sides (i.e. the line above it, if there is one, is amplifying, and the line below it, if there is one, is amplifying too).\n\nFor now those are the only instructions for removing unnecessary characters that you have to follow (oh yes, a newline is a character, too).\n\nThe input contains the text of the spell, which should be reduced. Remove the extra characters and print the result to the output.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input contains multiple lines. All characters in the lines have codes from 32 to 127 (inclusive). Please note that the lines may begin with or end with one or more spaces. The size of the input does not exceed 1048576 (<==<=220) bytes. Newlines are included in this size.\n\nIn the Windows operating system used on the testing computer, a newline is a sequence of characters with codes #13#10.

Alice knows that the only theoretically secure cipher is one-time pad. Alice generates a random key *K* of the length equal to the message's length. Alice computes the bitwise xor of each element of the message and the key (, where  denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR)) and stores this encrypted message *A*. Alice is smart. Be like Alice.\n\nFor example, Alice may have wanted to store a message *M*<==<=(0,<=15,<=9,<=18). She generated a key *K*<==<=(16,<=7,<=6,<=3). The encrypted message is thus *A*<==<=(16,<=8,<=15,<=17).\n\nAlice realised that she cannot store the key with the encrypted message. Alice sent her key *K* to Bob and deleted her own copy. Alice is smart. Really, be like Alice.\n\nBob realised that the encrypted message is only secure as long as the key is secret. Bob thus randomly permuted the key before storing it. Bob thinks that this way, even if Eve gets both the encrypted message and the key, she will not be able to read the message. Bob is not smart. Don't be like Bob.\n\nIn the above example, Bob may have, for instance, selected a permutation (3,<=4,<=1,<=2) and stored the permuted key *P*<==<=(6,<=3,<=16,<=7).\n\nOne year has passed and Alice wants to decrypt her message. Only now Bob has realised that this is impossible. As he has permuted the key randomly, the message is lost forever. Did we mention that Bob isn't smart?\n\nBob wants to salvage at least some information from the message. Since he is not so smart, he asks for your help. You know the encrypted message *A* and the permuted key *P*. What is the lexicographically smallest message that could have resulted in the given encrypted text?\n\nMore precisely, for given *A* and *P*, find the lexicographically smallest message *O*, for which there exists a permutation \u03c0 such that  for every *i*.\n\nNote that the sequence *S* is lexicographically smaller than the sequence *T*, if there is an index *i* such that *S**i*<=&lt;<=*T**i* and for all *j*<=&lt;<=*i* the condition *S**j*<==<=*T**j* holds.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *N* (1<=\u2264<=*N*<=\u2264<=300000), the length of the message. \n\nThe second line contains *N* integers *A*1,<=*A*2,<=...,<=*A**N* (0<=\u2264<=*A**i*<=&lt;<=230) representing the encrypted message.\n\nThe third line contains *N* integers *P*1,<=*P*2,<=...,<=*P**N* (0<=\u2264<=*P**i*<=&lt;<=230) representing the permuted encryption key.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput a single line with *N* integers, the lexicographically smallest possible message *O*.

To celebrate it Adil and Bera went to Central Perk where they can take bottles from the ground and put them into a recycling bin.\n\nWe can think Central Perk as coordinate plane. There are *n* bottles on the ground, the *i*-th bottle is located at position (*x**i*,<=*y**i*). Both Adil and Bera can carry only one bottle at once each. \n\nFor both Adil and Bera the process looks as follows: \n 1.  Choose to stop or to continue to collect bottles. 1.  If the choice was to continue then choose some bottle and walk towards it. 1.  Pick this bottle and walk to the recycling bin. 1.  Go to step 1. \nAdil and Bera may move independently. They are allowed to pick bottles simultaneously, all bottles may be picked by any of the two, it's allowed that one of them stays still while the other one continues to pick bottles.\n\nThey want to organize the process such that the total distance they walk (the sum of distance walked by Adil and distance walked by Bera) is minimum possible. Of course, at the end all bottles should lie in the recycling bin.\n\nInput Specification:\nFirst line of the input contains six integers *a**x*, *a**y*, *b**x*, *b**y*, *t**x* and *t**y* (0<=\u2264<=*a**x*,<=*a**y*,<=*b**x*,<=*b**y*,<=*t**x*,<=*t**y*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 initial positions of Adil, Bera and recycling bin respectively.\n\nThe second line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of bottles on the ground.\n\nThen follow *n* lines, each of them contains two integers *x**i* and *y**i* (0<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 position of the *i*-th bottle.\n\nIt's guaranteed that positions of Adil, Bera, recycling bin and all bottles are distinct.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint one real number\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible total distance Adil and Bera need to walk in order to put all bottles into recycling bin.

        "prompt": "Title: Colliders\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nBy 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *m* lines \u2014 the results of executing requests in the above given format. The requests should be processed in the order, in which they are given in the input.

He invented his own language called Petya's. Petya wanted to create a maximally simple language that would be enough to chat with friends, that's why all the language's grammar can be described with the following set of rules:\n-  There are three parts of speech: the adjective, the noun, the verb. Each word in his language is an adjective, noun or verb. -  There are two genders: masculine and feminine. Each word in his language has gender either masculine or feminine. -  Masculine adjectives end with -lios, and feminine adjectives end with -liala. -  Masculine nouns end with -etr, and feminime nouns end with -etra. -  Masculine verbs end with -initis, and feminime verbs end with -inites. -  Thus, each word in the Petya's language has one of the six endings, given above. There are no other endings in Petya's language. -  It is accepted that the whole word consists of an ending. That is, words \"lios\", \"liala\", \"etr\" and so on belong to the Petya's language. -  There aren't any punctuation marks, grammatical tenses, singular/plural forms or other language complications. -  A sentence is either exactly one valid language word or exactly one statement. \nStatement is any sequence of the Petya's language, that satisfy both conditions:\n-  Words in statement follow in the following order (from the left to the right): zero or more adjectives followed by exactly one noun followed by zero or more verbs. -  All words in the statement should have the same gender.\nAfter Petya's friend Vasya wrote instant messenger (an instant messaging program) that supported the Petya's language, Petya wanted to add spelling and grammar checking to the program. As Vasya was in the country and Petya didn't feel like waiting, he asked you to help him with this problem. Your task is to define by a given sequence of words, whether it is true that the given text represents exactly one sentence in Petya's language.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains one or more words consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The overall number of characters (including letters and spaces) does not exceed 105.\n\nIt is guaranteed that any two consecutive words are separated by exactly one space and the input data do not contain any other spaces. It is possible that given words do not belong to the Petya's language.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf some word of the given text does not belong to the Petya's language or if the text contains more that one sentence, print \"NO\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print \"YES\" (without the quotes).\n\nDemo Input:\n['petr\\n', 'etis atis animatis etis atis amatis\\n', 'nataliala kataliala vetra feinites\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

Oh, those creators of computer games! What they do not come up with! Absolutely unique monsters have been added to the The Elder Trolls IV: Oblivon. One of these monsters is Unkillable Slug. Why it is \"Unkillable\"? Firstly, because it can be killed with cutting weapon only, so lovers of two-handed amber hammers should find suitable knife themselves. Secondly, it is necessary to make so many cutting strokes to Unkillable Slug. Extremely many. Too many! \n\nVasya has already promoted his character to 80-th level and in order to gain level 81 he was asked to kill Unkillable Slug. The monster has a very interesting shape. It looks like a rectangular parallelepiped with size *x*<=\u00d7<=*y*<=\u00d7<=*z*, consisting of undestructable cells 1<=\u00d7<=1<=\u00d7<=1. At one stroke Vasya can cut the Slug along an imaginary grid, i.e. cut with a plane parallel to one of the parallelepiped side. Monster dies when amount of parts it is divided reaches some critical value.\n\nAll parts of monster do not fall after each cut, they remains exactly on its places. I. e. Vasya can cut several parts with one cut.\n\nVasya wants to know what the maximum number of pieces he can cut the Unkillable Slug into striking him at most *k* times.\n\nVasya's character uses absolutely thin sword with infinite length.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains four integer numbers *x*,<=*y*,<=*z*,<=*k* (1<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*<=\u2264<=106,<=0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=109).\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput the only number \u2014 the answer for the problem.\n\nPlease, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cout (also you may use %I64d).\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 2 2 3\\n', '2 2 2 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['8', '2']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample Vasya make 3 pairwise perpendicular cuts. He cuts monster on two parts with the first cut, then he divides each part on two with the second cut, and finally he divides each of the 4 parts on two.",

        "prompt": "Title: Photographs (I)\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe Human-Cow Confederation (*HC*2), led by Heidi, has built a base where people and cows can hide, guarded from zombie attacks. The entrance to the base is protected by an automated gate which performs a kind of a Turing test: it shows the entering creature a photograph and asks them whether the top and bottom halves of this photograph have been swapped or not. A person (or even a cow) will have no problem answering such questions; on the other hand, a zombie would just randomly smash one of the two buttons.\n\nThe creature is asked a series of such questions. If at least 75% of them are answered correctly, the gate is unlocked; otherwise, a side door opens, beneath which a huge fan is spinning...\n\nHeidi is now building a robot army to fight the zombies, and she wants the robots to also be able to enter the base. You are tasked with programming them to distinguish the images.\n\nThe first two images from the test set. The first picture has been rearranged, but not the second.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains the number *q* of questions (1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=220). After that, *q* questions follow, each of which in the format described below.\n\nThe first line of every question contains two space-separated integers *h* and *w* (1<=\u2264<=*h*,<=*w*<=\u2264<=600) \u2013 the height (number of rows) and width (number of columns) of the photograph. (Most photographs are roughly 200<=\u00d7<=300.) After this, *h* lines follow, each describing a single row of the picture. The picture is monochrome (in shades of grey). Its *i*-th row is described by *w* space-separated integers *a**ij* (*j*<==<=1,<=...,<=*w*), where *a**ij* is the brightness of the corresponding pixel (0<=\u2264<=*a**ij*<=&lt;<=256, where 0 is black and 255 is white).\n\nEach picture will be either a real-life photograph, or a real-life photograph which has been broken up into two pieces and rearranged. More precisely, in the latter case, the topmost  rows have been moved to the bottom of the picture. It is guaranteed that *h* is even.\n\nThere is only a single input file to be processed, called all.in, and it is downloadable from the online judge. You are also a given another input file, called sample.in, which contains the first 20 pictures from all.in; you are provided the correct answers for sample.in in sample.out. You are also given a directory easy_bmp, which contains the first 50 input photographs in the form of .bmp image files, as well as a directory easy_sample_original_bmp, which contains the first 20 images before rearrangement. Check the notes for the download links.\n\nOutput Specification:\nYour program should print *q* lines.

        "prompt": "Title: Greenhouse Effect\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nEmuskald is an avid horticulturist and owns the world's longest greenhouse \u2014 it is effectively infinite in length.\n\nOver the years Emuskald has cultivated *n* plants in his greenhouse, of *m* different plant species numbered from 1 to *m*. His greenhouse is very narrow and can be viewed as an infinite line, with each plant occupying a single point on that line.\n\nEmuskald has discovered that each species thrives at a different temperature, so he wants to arrange *m*<=-<=1 borders that would divide the greenhouse into *m* sections numbered from 1 to *m* from left to right with each section housing a single species. He is free to place the borders, but in the end all of the *i*-th species plants must reside in *i*-th section from the left.\n\nOf course, it is not always possible to place the borders in such way, so Emuskald needs to replant some of his plants. He can remove each plant from its position and place it anywhere in the greenhouse (at any real coordinate) with no plant already in it. Since replanting is a lot of stress for the plants, help Emuskald find the minimum number of plants he has to replant to be able to place the borders.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=5000, *n*<=\u2265<=*m*), the number of plants and the number of different species. Each of the following *n* lines contain two space-separated numbers: one integer number *s**i* (1<=\u2264<=*s**i*<=\u2264<=*m*), and one real number *x**i* (0<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=109), the species and position of the *i*-th plant. Each *x**i* will contain no more than 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all *x**i* are different; there is at least one plant of each species; the plants are given in order \"from left to the right\", that is in the ascending order of their *x**i* coordinates (*x**i*<=&lt;<=*x**i*<=+<=1,<=1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*n*).\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of plants to be replanted.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 2\\n2 1\\n1 2.0\\n1 3.100\\n', '3 3\\n1 5.0\\n2 5.5\\n3 6.0\\n', '6 3\\n1 14.284235\\n2 17.921382\\n1 20.328172\\n3 20.842331\\n1 25.790145\\n1 27.204125\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '0\\n', '2\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first test case, Emuskald can replant the first plant to the right of the last plant, so the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second test case, the species are already in the correct order, so no replanting is needed.",

        "prompt": "Title: Memory Manager\n\nTime Limit: 1 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 64 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThere is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed. Successful procession of alloc operation should return integers, starting with 1, as the identifiers of the allocated blocks.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6 10\\nalloc 5\\nalloc 3\\nerase 1\\nalloc 6\\ndefragment\\nalloc 6\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n2\\nNULL\\n3\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

The *i*-th dice shows numbers from 1 to *d**i*. Polycarp rolled all the dice and the sum of numbers they showed is *A*. Agrippina didn't see which dice showed what number, she knows only the sum *A* and the values *d*1,<=*d*2,<=...,<=*d**n*. However, she finds it enough to make a series of statements of the following type: dice *i* couldn't show number *r*. For example, if Polycarp had two six-faced dice and the total sum is *A*<==<=11, then Agrippina can state that each of the two dice couldn't show a value less than five (otherwise, the remaining dice must have a value of at least seven, which is impossible).\n\nFor each dice find the number of values for which it can be guaranteed that the dice couldn't show these values if the sum of the shown values is *A*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n*,<=*A* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105,<=*n*<=\u2264<=*A*<=\u2264<=*s*) \u2014 the number of dice and the sum of shown values where *s*<==<=*d*1<=+<=*d*2<=+<=...<=+<=*d**n*.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *d*1,<=*d*2,<=...,<=*d**n* (1<=\u2264<=*d**i*<=\u2264<=106), where *d**i* is the maximum value that the *i*-th dice can show.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *n* integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n*, where *b**i* is the number of values for which it is guaranteed that the *i*-th dice couldn't show them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 8\\n4 4\\n', '1 3\\n5\\n', '2 3\\n2 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3 3 ', '4 ', '0 1 ']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample from the statement *A* equal to 8 could be obtained in the only case when both the first and the second dice show 4.

So Alice and Bob have invented a new game to play. The rules are as follows. First, they get a set of *n* distinct integers. And then they take turns to make the following moves. During each move, either Alice or Bob (the player whose turn is the current) can choose two distinct integers *x* and *y* from the set, such that the set doesn't contain their absolute difference |*x*<=-<=*y*|. Then this player adds integer |*x*<=-<=*y*| to the set (so, the size of the set increases by one).\n\nIf the current player has no valid move, he (or she) loses the game.

For that they've already found a hefty deck of *n* playing cards. Let's describe the house they want to make: \n 1.  The house consists of some non-zero number of floors. 1.  Each floor consists of a non-zero number of rooms and the ceiling. A room is two cards that are leaned towards each other. The rooms are made in a row, each two adjoining rooms share a ceiling made by another card. 1.  Each floor besides for the lowest one should contain less rooms than the floor below. \nPlease note that the house may end by the floor with more than one room, and in this case they also must be covered by the ceiling. Also, the number of rooms on the adjoining floors doesn't have to differ by one, the difference may be more. \n\nWhile bears are practicing to put cards, Horace tries to figure out how many floors their house should consist of. The height of the house is the number of floors in it. It is possible that you can make a lot of different houses of different heights out of *n* cards. It seems that the elephant cannot solve this problem and he asks you to count the number of the distinct heights of the houses that they can make using exactly *n* cards.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe single line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1012) \u2014 the number of cards.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the number of distinct heights that the houses made of exactly *n* cards can have.\n\nDemo Input:\n['13\\n', '6\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1', '0']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample you can build only these two houses (remember, you must use all the cards):\n\nThus, 13 cards are enough only for two floor houses, so the answer is 1.\n\nThe six cards in the second sample are not enough to build any house.",

Ilya writes programs for entertainment robots, and his current project is \"Bob\", a new-generation game robot. Ilya's boss wants to know his progress so far. Especially he is interested if Bob is better at playing different games than the previous model, \"Alice\". \n\nSo now Ilya wants to compare his robots' performance in a simple game called \"1-2-3\". This game is similar to the \"Rock-Paper-Scissors\" game: both robots secretly choose a number from the set {1,<=2,<=3} and say it at the same moment. If both robots choose the same number, then it's a draw and noone gets any points. But if chosen numbers are different, then one of the robots gets a point: 3 beats 2, 2 beats 1 and 1 beats 3. \n\nBoth robots' programs make them choose their numbers in such a way that their choice in (*i*<=+<=1)-th game depends only on the numbers chosen by them in *i*-th game. \n\nIlya knows that the robots will play *k* games, Alice will choose number *a* in the first game, and Bob will choose *b* in the first game. He also knows both robots' programs and can tell what each robot will choose depending on their choices in previous game. Ilya doesn't want to wait until robots play all *k* games, so he asks you to predict the number of points they will have after the final game.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three numbers *k*, *a*, *b* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=1018, 1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=3). \n\nThen 3 lines follow, *i*-th of them containing 3 numbers *A**i*,<=1, *A**i*,<=2, *A**i*,<=3, where *A**i*,<=*j* represents Alice's choice in the game if Alice chose *i* in previous game and Bob chose *j* (1<=\u2264<=*A**i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=3). \n\nThen 3 lines follow, *i*-th of them containing 3 numbers *B**i*,<=1, *B**i*,<=2, *B**i*,<=3, where *B**i*,<=*j* represents Bob's choice in the game if Alice chose *i* in previous game and Bob chose *j* (1<=\u2264<=*B**i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=3).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint two numbers. First of them has to be equal to the number of points Alice will have, and second of them must be Bob's score after *k* games.\n\nDemo Input:\n['10 2 1\\n1 1 1\\n1 1 1\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 2\\n2 2 2\\n2 2 2\\n', '8 1 1\\n2 2 1\\n3 3 1\\n3 1 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 1 1\\n1 2 3\\n', '5 1 1\\n1 2 2\\n2 2 2\\n2 2 2\\n1 2 2\\n2 2 2\\n2 2 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1 9\\n', '5 2\\n', '0 0\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the second example game goes like this:\n\n<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/1e21b6e200707470571d69c9946ace6b56f5279b.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\nThe fourth and the seventh game are won by Bob, the first game is draw and the rest are won by Alice.",

        "prompt": "Title: Merge Sort\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nMerge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf a permutation of size *n* such that there will be exactly *k* calls of *mergesort* while sorting it doesn't exist, output <=-<=1. Otherwise output *n* integer numbers *a*[0],<=*a*[1],<=...,<=*a*[*n*<=-<=1] \u2014 the elements of a permutation that would meet the required conditions. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 3\\n', '4 1\\n', '5 6\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2 1 3 ', '1 2 3 4 ', '-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

There are *n* available fountains, for each fountain its beauty and cost are known. There are two types of money in the game: coins and diamonds, so each fountain cost can be either in coins or diamonds. No money changes between the types are allowed.\n\nHelp Arkady to find two fountains with maximum total beauty so that he can buy both at the same time.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *c* and *d* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000, 0<=\u2264<=*c*,<=*d*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of fountains, the number of coins and diamonds Arkady has.\n\nThe next *n* lines describe fountains.

The first fountain he can't build because he don't have enough coins. Also Arkady should build the third fountain with beauty 5 which costs 6 diamonds. Thus the total beauty of built fountains is 9.\n\nIn the second example there are two fountains, but Arkady can't build both of them, because he needs 5 coins for the first fountain, and Arkady has only 4 coins.",

This time the Beaver invites the contest participants to check out a problem on sorting documents by their subjects. Let's describe the problem:\n\nYou've got some training set of documents. For each document you know its subject. The subject in this problem is an integer from 1 to 3. Each of these numbers has a physical meaning. For instance, all documents with subject 3 are about trade.\n\nYou can download the training set of documents at the following link: http://download4.abbyy.com/a2/X2RZ2ZWXBG5VYWAL61H76ZQM/train.zip. The archive contains three directories with names \"1\", \"2\", \"3\". Directory named \"1\" contains documents on the 1-st subject, directory \"2\" contains documents on the 2-nd subject, and directory \"3\" contains documents on the 3-rd subject. Each document corresponds to exactly one file from some directory.\n\nAll documents have the following format: the first line contains the document identifier, the second line contains the name of the document, all subsequent lines contain the text of the document. The document identifier is used to make installing the problem more convenient and has no useful information for the participants.\n\nYou need to write a program that should indicate the subject for a given document. It is guaranteed that all documents given as input to your program correspond to one of the three subjects of the training set.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *id* (0<=\u2264<=*id*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 the document identifier. The second line contains the name of the document. The third and the subsequent lines contain the text of the document. It is guaranteed that the size of any given document will not exceed 10 kilobytes.\n\nThe tests for this problem are divided into 10 groups. Documents of groups 1 and 2 are taken from the training set, but their identifiers will not match the identifiers specified in the training set. Groups from the 3-rd to the 10-th are roughly sorted by the author in ascending order of difficulty (these groups contain documents which aren't present in the training set).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint an integer from 1 to 3, inclusive \u2014 the number of the subject the given document corresponds to.\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Primes or Palindromes?\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nRikhail Mubinchik believes that the current definition of prime numbers is obsolete as they are too complex and unpredictable. A palindromic number is another matter. It is aesthetically pleasing, and it has a number of remarkable properties. Help Rikhail to convince the scientific community in this!\n\nLet us remind you that a number is called prime if it is integer larger than one, and is not divisible by any positive integer other than itself and one.\n\nRikhail calls a number a palindromic if it is integer, positive, and its decimal representation without leading zeros is a palindrome, i.e. reads the same from left to right and right to left.\n\nOne problem with prime numbers is that there are too many of them. Let's introduce the following notation: \u03c0(*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of primes no larger than *n*, *rub*(*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of palindromic numbers no larger than *n*. Rikhail wants to prove that there are a lot more primes than palindromic ones.\n\nHe asked you to solve the following problem: for a given value of the coefficient *A* find the maximum *n*, such that \u03c0(*n*)<=\u2264<=*A*\u00b7*rub*(*n*).\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input consists of two positive integers *p*, *q*, the numerator and denominator of the fraction that is the value of *A*\u00a0(,\u00a0).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf such maximum number exists, then print it. Otherwise, print \"Palindromic tree is better than splay tree\" (without the quotes).\n\nDemo Input:\n['1 1\\n', '1 42\\n', '6 4\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['40\\n', '1\\n', '172\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

After each video is uploaded, it should be recompressed on one (any) of the servers, and only after that it can be saved in the social network.\n\nWe know that each server takes one second to recompress a one minute fragment. Thus, any server takes *m* seconds to recompress a *m* minute video.\n\nWe know the time when each of the *n* videos were uploaded to the network (in seconds starting from the moment all servers started working). All videos appear at different moments of time and they are recompressed in the order they appear. If some video appeared at time *s*, then its recompressing can start at that very moment, immediately. Some videos can await recompressing when all the servers are busy. In this case, as soon as a server is available, it immediately starts recompressing another video. The videos that await recompressing go in a queue. If by the moment the videos started being recompressed some servers are available, then any of them starts recompressing the video.\n\nFor each video find the moment it stops being recompressed.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=5\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of videos and servers, respectively.\n\nNext *n* lines contain the descriptions of the videos as pairs of integers *s**i*,<=*m**i* (1<=\u2264<=*s**i*,<=*m**i*<=\u2264<=109), where *s**i* is the time in seconds when the *i*-th video appeared and *m**i* is its duration in minutes.

Two ways are different if any of the junctions contains a checkpost in one of them and do not contain in the other.\n\nInput Specification:\nIn the first line, you will be given an integer *n*, number of junctions (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105). In the next line, *n* space-separated integers will be given. The *i**th* integer is the cost of building checkpost at the *i**th* junction (costs will be non-negative and will not exceed 109).\n\nThe next line will contain an integer *m*\u00a0(0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105). And each of the next *m* lines contains two integers *u**i* and *v**i*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*;\u00a0*u*<=\u2260<=*v*). A pair *u**i*,<=*v**i* means, that there is a one-way road which goes from *u**i* to *v**i*. There will not be more than one road between two nodes in the same direction.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint two integers separated by spaces. The first one is the minimum possible money needed to ensure the security of all the junctions. And the second one is the number of ways you can ensure the security modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n1 2 3\\n3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 2\\n', '5\\n2 8 0 6 0\\n6\\n1 4\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n3 4\\n4 5\\n5 1\\n', '10\\n1 3 2 2 1 3 1 4 10 10\\n12\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1\\n3 4\\n4 5\\n5 6\\n5 7\\n6 4\\n7 3\\n8 9\\n9 10\\n10 9\\n', '2\\n7 91\\n2\\n1 2\\n2 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3 1\\n', '8 2\\n', '15 6\\n', '7 1\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

To finish the work, he needs a resistor with a certain resistance value.\n\nHowever, all Mike has is lots of identical resistors with unit resistance *R*0<==<=1. Elements with other resistance can be constructed from these resistors. In this problem, we will consider the following as elements: \n 1.  one resistor; 1.  an element and one resistor plugged in sequence; 1.  an element and one resistor plugged in parallel. \nWith the consecutive connection the resistance of the new element equals *R*<==<=*R**e*<=+<=*R*0.

        "prompt": "Title: Heap Operations\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nPetya has recently learned data structure named \"Binary heap\".\n\nThe heap he is now operating with allows the following operations: \n -  put the given number into the heap; -  get the value of the minimum element in the heap; -  extract the minimum element from the heap; \nThus, at any moment of time the heap contains several integers (possibly none), some of them might be equal.\n\nIn order to better learn this data structure Petya took an empty heap and applied some operations above to it. Also, he carefully wrote down all the operations and their results to his event log, following the format: \n -  insert *x*\u00a0\u2014 put the element with value *x* in the heap; -  getMin *x*\u00a0\u2014 the value of the minimum element contained in the heap was equal to *x*; -  removeMin\u00a0\u2014 the minimum element was extracted from the heap (only one instance, if there were many). \nAll the operations were correct, i.e. there was at least one element in the heap each time getMin or removeMin operations were applied.\n\nWhile Petya was away for a lunch, his little brother Vova came to the room, took away some of the pages from Petya's log and used them to make paper boats.\n\nNow Vova is worried, if he made Petya's sequence of operations inconsistent. For example, if one apply operations one-by-one in the order they are written in the event log, results of getMin operations might differ from the results recorded by Petya, and some of getMin or removeMin operations may be incorrect, as the heap is empty at the moment they are applied.\n\nNow Vova wants to add some new operation records to the event log in order to make the resulting sequence of operations correct. That is, the result of each getMin operation is equal to the result in the record, and the heap is non-empty when getMin ad removeMin are applied. Vova wants to complete this as fast as possible, as the Petya may get back at any moment. He asks you to add the least possible number of operation records to the current log. Note that arbitrary number of operations may be added at the beginning, between any two other operations, or at the end of the log.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains the only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the records left in Petya's journal.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines describe the records in the current log in the order they are applied. Format described in the statement is used. All numbers in the input are integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.\n\nOutput Specification:\nThe first line of the output should contain a single integer *m*\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible number of records in the modified sequence of operations.\n\nNext *m* lines should contain the corrected sequence of records following the format of the input (described in the statement), one per line and in the order they are applied. All the numbers in the output should be integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.\n\nNote that the input sequence of operations must be the subsequence of the output sequence.\n\nIt's guaranteed that there exists the correct answer consisting of no more than 1<=000<=000 operations.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2\\ninsert 3\\ngetMin 4\\n', '4\\ninsert 1\\ninsert 1\\nremoveMin\\ngetMin 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4\\ninsert 3\\nremoveMin\\ninsert 4\\ngetMin 4\\n', '6\\ninsert 1\\ninsert 1\\nremoveMin\\nremoveMin\\ninsert 2\\ngetMin 2\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, after number 3 is inserted into the heap, the minimum number is 3. To make the result of the first getMin equal to 4 one should firstly remove number 3 from the heap and then add number 4 into the heap.\n\nIn the second sample case number 1 is inserted two times, so should be similarly removed twice.",

        "prompt": "Title: Script Generation\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe Smart Beaver from ABBYY was offered a job of a screenwriter for the ongoing TV series. In particular, he needs to automate the hard decision: which main characters will get married by the end of the series.\n\nThere are *n* single men and *n* single women among the main characters. An opinion poll showed that viewers like several couples, and a marriage of any of them will make the audience happy. The Smart Beaver formalized this fact as *k* triples of numbers (*h*,<=*w*,<=*r*), where *h* is the index of the man, *w* is the index of the woman, and *r* is the measure of the audience's delight in case of the marriage of this couple. The same poll showed that the marriage of any other couple will leave the audience indifferent, so the screenwriters decided not to include any such marriages in the plot.\n\nThe script allows you to arrange several marriages between the heroes or not to arrange marriages at all. A subset of some of the *k* marriages is considered acceptable if each man and each woman is involved in at most one marriage of the subset (the series won't allow any divorces). The value of the acceptable set of marriages is the total delight the spectators will get from the marriages included in this set.\n\nObviously, there is a finite number of acceptable sets, and they all describe some variants of the script. The screenwriters do not want to choose a set with maximum value \u2014 it would make the plot too predictable. So the Smart Beaver offers the following option: sort all the acceptable sets in increasing order of value and choose the *t*-th set from the sorted list.

The second line contains a pair of space-separated positive integers *a*, *b* (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=108).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if the method satisfying conditions above exists. In this case, next print two lines \u2014 the left and right parts after the cut. These two parts, being concatenated, must be exactly identical to the public key. The left part must be divisible by *a*, and the right part must be divisible by *b*. The two parts must be positive integers having no leading zeros.

In this system each point corresponds to three real coordinates (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*). In this coordinate system, the distance between the center of the Universe and the point is calculated by the following formula: .

Recently Copa understood that to conquer the world he needs to organize the world Codeforces tournament. He hopes that after it the brightest minds will become his subordinates, and the toughest part of conquering the world will be completed.\n\nThe final round of the Codeforces World Finals 20YY is scheduled for *DD*.*MM*.*YY*, where *DD* is the day of the round, *MM* is the month and *YY* are the last two digits of the year. Bob is lucky to be the first finalist form Berland. But there is one problem: according to the rules of the competition, all participants must be at least 18 years old at the moment of the finals. Bob was born on *BD*.*BM*.*BY*. This date is recorded in his passport, the copy of which he has already mailed to the organizers. But Bob learned that in different countries the way, in which the dates are written, differs. For example, in the US the month is written first, then the day and finally the year. Bob wonders if it is possible to rearrange the numbers in his date of birth so that he will be at least 18 years old on the day *DD*.*MM*.*YY*. He can always tell that in his motherland dates are written differently. Help him.\n\nAccording to another strange rule, eligible participant must be born in the same century as the date of the finals. If the day of the finals is participant's 18-th birthday, he is allowed to participate. \n\nAs we are considering only the years from 2001 to 2099 for the year of the finals, use the following rule: the year is leap if it's number is divisible by four.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains the date *DD*.*MM*.*YY*, the second line contains the date *BD*.*BM*.*BY*. It is guaranteed that both dates are correct, and *YY* and *BY* are always in [01;99].\n\nIt could be that by passport Bob was born after the finals. In this case, he can still change the order of numbers in date.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf it is possible to rearrange the numbers in the date of birth so that Bob will be at least 18 years old on the *DD*.*MM*.*YY*, output YES. In the other case, output NO. \n\nEach number contains exactly two digits and stands for day, month or year in a date.

She heard a rumor: the authors list on the paper is always sorted in the lexicographical order. \n\nAfter checking some examples, she found out that sometimes it wasn't true. On some papers authors' names weren't sorted in lexicographical order in normal sense. But it was always true that after some modification of the order of letters in alphabet, the order of authors becomes lexicographical!\n\nShe wants to know, if there exists an order of letters in Latin alphabet such that the names on the paper she is submitting are following in the lexicographical order. If so, you should find out any such order.\n\nLexicographical order is defined in following way. When we compare *s* and *t*, first we find the leftmost position with differing characters: *s**i*<=\u2260<=*t**i*. If there is no such position (i. e. *s* is a prefix of *t* or vice versa) the shortest string is less. Otherwise, we compare characters *s**i* and *t**i* according to their order in alphabet.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100): number of names.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contain one string *name**i* (1<=\u2264<=|*name**i*|<=\u2264<=100), the *i*-th name. Each name contains only lowercase Latin letters. All names are different.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf there exists such order of letters that the given names are sorted lexicographically, output any such order as a permutation of characters 'a'\u2013'z' (i. e. first output the first letter of the modified alphabet, then the second, and so on).\n\nOtherwise output a single word \"Impossible\" (without quotes).\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\nrivest\\nshamir\\nadleman\\n', '10\\ntourist\\npetr\\nwjmzbmr\\nyeputons\\nvepifanov\\nscottwu\\noooooooooooooooo\\nsubscriber\\nrowdark\\ntankengineer\\n', '10\\npetr\\negor\\nendagorion\\nfeferivan\\nilovetanyaromanova\\nkostka\\ndmitriyh\\nmaratsnowbear\\nbredorjaguarturnik\\ncgyforever\\n', '7\\ncar\\ncare\\ncareful\\ncarefully\\nbecarefuldontforgetsomething\\notherwiseyouwillbehacked\\ngoodluck\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['bcdefghijklmnopqrsatuvwxyz\\n', 'Impossible\\n', 'aghjlnopefikdmbcqrstuvwxyz\\n', 'acbdefhijklmnogpqrstuvwxyz\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Bulls and Cows\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe \"Bulls and Cows\" game needs two people to play. The thinker thinks of a number and the guesser tries to guess it.\n\nThe thinker thinks of a four-digit number in the decimal system. All the digits in the number are different and the number may have a leading zero. It can't have more than one leading zero, because all it's digits should be different. The guesser tries to guess the number. He makes a series of guesses, trying experimental numbers and receives answers from the first person in the format \"*x* bulls *y* cows\". *x* represents the number of digits in the experimental number that occupy the same positions as in the sought number. *y* represents the number of digits of the experimental number that present in the sought number, but occupy different positions. Naturally, the experimental numbers, as well as the sought number, are represented by four-digit numbers where all digits are different and a leading zero can be present.\n\nFor example, let's suppose that the thinker thought of the number 0123. Then the guessers' experimental number 1263 will receive a reply \"1 bull 2 cows\" (3 occupies the same positions in both numbers and 1 and 2 are present in both numbers but they occupy different positions). Also, the answer to number 8103 will be \"2 bulls 1 cow\" (analogically, 1 and 3 occupy the same positions and 0 occupies a different one). \n\nWhen the guesser is answered \"4 bulls 0 cows\", the game is over.\n\nNow the guesser has already made several guesses and wants to know whether his next guess can possibly be the last one.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=10) which represents the number of already made guesses. Then follow *n* lines in the form of \"*a**i* *b**i* *c**i*\", where *a**i* is the *i*-th experimental number, *b**i* is the number of bulls, *c**i* is the number of cows (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*, 0<=\u2264<=*b**i*,<=*c**i*,<=*b**i*<=+<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=4). The experimental numbers are correct, i.e., each of them contains exactly four digits, in each of them all the four digits are different, and there can be a leading zero. All the experimental numbers are different. As the guesser hasn't guessed the number yet, the answer \"4 bulls 0 cows\" is not present.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf the input data is enough to determine the sought number, print the number with four digits on a single line. If it has less than four digits, add leading zero. If the data is not enough, print \"Need more data\" without the quotes.

Each element of the matrix is equal to either 0 or 1. Rows and columns are 1-indexed. Ivan can replace any number of ones in this matrix with zeroes. After that, his score in the game will be calculated as follows:\n 1.  Initially Ivan's score is 0; 1.  In each column, Ivan will find the topmost 1 (that is, if the current column is *j*, then he will find minimum *i* such that *a**i*,<=*j*<==<=1). If there are no 1's in the column, this column is skipped; 1.  Ivan will look at the next *min*(*k*,<=*n*<=-<=*i*<=+<=1) elements in this column (starting from the element he found) and count the number of 1's among these elements.

On the other hand, he does not want to create a rapid widening or narrowing of the road, which would lead to car accidents. To avoid that, the Mayor decided that width of the road for consecutive parts should differ by at most 1, i.e. for each *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*n*) the inequation |*s*'*i*<=+<=1<=-<=*s*'*i*|<=\u2264<=1 should hold.

Your task is to find a number that occurs the maximum number of times in this array.\n\nHowever, before looking for such number, you are allowed to perform not more than *k* following operations \u2014 choose an arbitrary element from the array and add 1 to it. In other words, you are allowed to increase some array element by 1 no more than *k* times (you are allowed to increase the same element of the array multiple times).\n\nYour task is to find the maximum number of occurrences of some number in the array after performing no more than *k* allowed operations. If there are several such numbers, your task is to find the minimum one.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105; 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the number of elements in the array and the number of operations you are allowed to perform, correspondingly.\n\nThe third line contains a sequence of *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (|*a**i*|<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the initial array. The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn a single line print two numbers \u2014 the maximum number of occurrences of some number in the array after at most *k* allowed operations are performed, and the minimum number that reaches the given maximum.

Thus, we get sequence 6,\u20094,\u20094,\u20090,\u20094, where number 4 occurs 3 times.\n\nIn the second sample you don't need to perform a single operation or increase each element by one. If we do nothing, we get array 5,\u20095,\u20095, if we increase each by one, we get 6,\u20096,\u20096. In both cases the maximum number of occurrences equals 3. So we should do nothing, as number 5 is less than number 6.\n\nIn the third sample we should increase the second array element once and the fifth element once.

Also, he knows spells of two types that can faster the process of preparing potions.\n 1.  Spells of this type speed up the preparation time of one potion. There are *m* spells of this type, the *i*-th of them costs *b**i* manapoints and changes the preparation time of each potion to *a**i* instead of *x*. 1.  Spells of this type immediately prepare some number of potions. There are *k* such spells, the *i*-th of them costs *d**i* manapoints and instantly create *c**i* potions. \nAnton can use no more than one spell of the first type and no more than one spell of the second type, and the total number of manapoints spent should not exceed *s*. Consider that all spells are used instantly and right before Anton starts to prepare potions.\n\nAnton wants to get to the next level as fast as possible, so he is interested in the minimum number of time he needs to spent in order to prepare at least *n* potions.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7109,<=1<=\u2264<=*m*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of potions, Anton has to make, the number of spells of the first type and the number of spells of the second type.\n\nThe second line of the input contains two integers *x* and *s* (2<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7109,<=1<=\u2264<=*s*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7109)\u00a0\u2014 the initial number of seconds required to prepare one potion and the number of manapoints Anton can use.\n\nThe third line contains *m* integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=&lt;<=*x*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of seconds it will take to prepare one potion if the *i*-th spell of the first type is used.\n\nThe fourth line contains *m* integers *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7109)\u00a0\u2014 the number of manapoints to use the *i*-th spell of the first type.\n\nThere are *k* integers *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) in the fifth line\u00a0\u2014 the number of potions that will be immediately created if the *i*-th spell of the second type is used.

Cities are connected via bidirectional roads. Each road connects two distinct cities. No two roads connect the same pair of cities.\n\nBear Limak was once in a city *a* and he wanted to go to a city *b*. There was no direct connection so he decided to take a long walk, visiting each city exactly once. Formally: \n -  There is no road between *a* and *b*. -  There exists a sequence (path) of *n* distinct cities *v*1,<=*v*2,<=...,<=*v**n* that *v*1<==<=*a*, *v**n*<==<=*b* and there is a road between *v**i* and *v**i*<=+<=1 for . \nOn the other day, the similar thing happened. Limak wanted to travel between a city *c* and a city *d*. There is no road between them but there exists a sequence of *n* distinct cities *u*1,<=*u*2,<=...,<=*u**n* that *u*1<==<=*c*, *u**n*<==<=*d* and there is a road between *u**i* and *u**i*<=+<=1 for .\n\nAlso, Limak thinks that there are at most *k* roads in Bearland.

Otherwise, print two lines with paths descriptions. The first of these two lines should contain *n* distinct integers *v*1,<=*v*2,<=...,<=*v**n* where *v*1<==<=*a* and *v**n*<==<=*b*. The second line should contain *n* distinct integers *u*1,<=*u*2,<=...,<=*u**n* where *u*1<==<=*c* and *u**n*<==<=*d*.\n\nTwo paths generate at most 2*n*<=-<=2 roads: (*v*1,<=*v*2),<=(*v*2,<=*v*3),<=...,<=(*v**n*<=-<=1,<=*v**n*),<=(*u*1,<=*u*2),<=(*u*2,<=*u*3),<=...,<=(*u**n*<=-<=1,<=*u**n*). Your answer will be considered wrong if contains more than *k* distinct roads or any other condition breaks.

No road connects a city to itself, and each pair of cities is connected by no more than one road. It is not guaranteed that you can get from any city to any other one, using only the existing roads.\n\nThe President of Berland decided to make changes to the road system and instructed the Ministry of Transport to make this reform. Now, each road should be unidirectional (only lead from one city to another).\n\nIn order not to cause great resentment among residents, the reform needs to be conducted so that there can be as few separate cities as possible.

How can he explain to his literature teacher that he isn't going to become a writer? In fact, he is going to become a programmer. So, he would take great pleasure in writing a program, but none \u2014 in writing a composition.\n\nAs Vasya was fishing for a sentence in the dark pond of his imagination, he suddenly wondered: what is the least number of times he should push a key to shift the cursor from one position to another one?\n\nLet's describe his question more formally: to type a text, Vasya is using the text editor. He has already written *n* lines, the *i*-th line contains *a**i* characters (including spaces). If some line contains *k* characters, then this line overall contains (*k*<=+<=1) positions where the cursor can stand: before some character or after all characters (at the end of the line). Thus, the cursor's position is determined by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*), where *r* is the number of the line and *c* is the cursor's position in the line (the positions are indexed starting from one from the beginning of the line).\n\nVasya doesn't use the mouse to move the cursor. He uses keys \"Up\", \"Down\", \"Right\" and \"Left\". When he pushes each of these keys, the cursor shifts in the needed direction. Let's assume that before the corresponding key is pressed, the cursor was located in the position (*r*,<=*c*), then Vasya pushed key:\n-  \"Up\": if the cursor was located in the first line (*r*<==<=1), then it does not move. Otherwise, it moves to the previous line (with number *r*<=-<=1), to the same position. At that, if the previous line was short, that is, the cursor couldn't occupy position *c* there, the cursor moves to the last position of the line with number *r*<=-<=1;-  \"Down\": if the cursor was located in the last line (*r*<==<=*n*), then it does not move. Otherwise, it moves to the next line (with number *r*<=+<=1), to the same position. At that, if the next line was short, that is, the cursor couldn't occupy position *c* there, the cursor moves to the last position of the line with number *r*<=+<=1;-  \"Right\": if the cursor can move to the right in this line (*c*<=&lt;<=*a**r*<=+<=1), then it moves to the right (to position *c*<=+<=1). Otherwise, it is located at the end of the line and doesn't move anywhere when Vasya presses the \"Right\" key;-  \"Left\": if the cursor can move to the left in this line (*c*<=&gt;<=1), then it moves to the left (to position *c*<=-<=1). Otherwise, it is located at the beginning of the line and doesn't move anywhere when Vasya presses the \"Left\" key.\nYou've got the number of lines in the text file and the number of characters, written in each line of this file. Find the least number of times Vasya should push the keys, described above, to shift the cursor from position (*r*1,<=*c*1) to position (*r*2,<=*c*2).\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of lines in the file. The second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=105), separated by single spaces. The third line contains four integers *r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2 (1<=\u2264<=*r*1,<=*r*2<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*c*1<=\u2264<=*a**r*1<=+<=1,<=1<=\u2264<=*c*2<=\u2264<=*a**r*2<=+<=1).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of times Vasya should push a key to move the cursor from position (*r*1,<=*c*1) to position (*r*2,<=*c*2).\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n2 1 6 4\\n3 4 4 2\\n', '4\\n10 5 6 4\\n1 11 4 2\\n', '3\\n10 1 10\\n1 10 1 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n', '6\\n', '3\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample the editor contains four lines. Let's represent the cursor's possible positions in the line as numbers. Letter *s* represents the cursor's initial position, letter *t* represents the last one. Then all possible positions of the cursor in the text editor are described by the following table.\n\n123\n\n12\n\n123s567\n\n1t345\n\nOne of the possible answers in the given sample is: \"Left\", \"Down\", \"Left\".",

The graph had an interesting property: there were at most *k* edges adjacent to each of its vertices. For convenience, we will assume that the graph vertices were indexed by integers from 1 to *n*.\n\nOne day Valera counted the shortest distances from one of the graph vertices to all other ones and wrote them out in array *d*. Thus, element *d*[*i*] of the array shows the shortest distance from the vertex Valera chose to vertex number *i*.\n\nThen something irreparable terrible happened. Valera lost the initial graph. However, he still has the array *d*. Help him restore the lost graph.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=&lt;<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).

        "prompt": "Title: Wizards and Trolleybuses\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIn some country live wizards. They love to ride trolleybuses.\n\nA city in this country has a trolleybus depot with *n* trolleybuses. Every day the trolleybuses leave the depot, one by one and go to the final station. The final station is at a distance of *d* meters from the depot. We know for the *i*-th trolleybus that it leaves at the moment of time *t**i* seconds, can go at a speed of no greater than *v**i* meters per second, and accelerate with an acceleration no greater than *a* meters per second squared. A trolleybus can decelerate as quickly as you want (magic!). It can change its acceleration as fast as you want, as well. Note that the maximum acceleration is the same for all trolleys.\n\nDespite the magic the trolleys are still powered by an electric circuit and cannot overtake each other (the wires are to blame, of course). If a trolleybus catches up with another one, they go together one right after the other until they arrive at the final station. Also, the drivers are driving so as to arrive at the final station as quickly as possible.\n\nYou, as head of the trolleybuses' fans' club, are to determine for each trolley the minimum time by which it can reach the final station. At the time of arrival at the destination station the trolleybus does not necessarily have zero speed. When a trolley is leaving the depot, its speed is considered equal to zero. From the point of view of physics, the trolleybuses can be considered as material points, and also we should ignore the impact on the speed of a trolley bus by everything, except for the acceleration and deceleration provided by the engine.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains three space-separated integers *n*, *a*, *d* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*d*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 the number of trolleybuses, their maximum acceleration and the distance from the depot to the final station, correspondingly.\n\nNext *n* lines contain pairs of integers *t**i* *v**i* (0<=\u2264<=*t*1<=&lt;<=*t*2...<=&lt;<=*t**n*<=-<=1<=&lt;<=*t**n*<=\u2264<=106, 1<=\u2264<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 the time when the *i*-th trolleybus leaves the depot and its maximum speed, correspondingly. The numbers in the lines are separated by spaces.\n\nOutput Specification:\nFor each trolleybus print a single line the time it arrives to the final station. Print the times for the trolleybuses in the order in which the trolleybuses are given in the input. The answer will be accepted if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10<=-<=4.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 10 10000\\n0 10\\n5 11\\n1000 1\\n', '1 2 26\\n28 29\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1000.5000000000\\n1000.5000000000\\n11000.0500000000\\n', '33.0990195136\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample the second trolleybus will catch up with the first one, that will happen at distance 510.5 meters from the depot. The trolleybuses will go the remaining 9489.5 meters together at speed 10 meters per second. As a result, both trolleybuses will arrive to the final station by the moment of time 1000.5 seconds.

Most of all dances Artem likes rueda\u00a0\u2014 Cuban dance that is danced by pairs of boys and girls forming a circle and dancing together.\n\nMore detailed, there are *n* pairs of boys and girls standing in a circle. Initially, boy number 1 dances with a girl number 1, boy number 2 dances with a girl number 2 and so on. Girls are numbered in the clockwise order. During the dance different moves are announced and all pairs perform this moves. While performing moves boys move along the circle, while girls always stay at their initial position. For the purpose of this problem we consider two different types of moves:\n 1.  Value *x* and some direction are announced, and all boys move *x* positions in the corresponding direction. 1.  Boys dancing with even-indexed girls swap positions with boys who are dancing with odd-indexed girls. That is the one who was dancing with the girl 1 swaps with the one who was dancing with the girl number 2, while the one who was dancing with girl number 3 swaps with the one who was dancing with the girl number 4 and so one. It's guaranteed that *n* is even. \nYour task is to determine the final position of each boy.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *q* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1<=000<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=2<=000<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of couples in the rueda and the number of commands to perform, respectively. It's guaranteed that *n* is even.\n\nNext *q* lines contain the descriptions of the commands. Each command has type as the integer 1 or 2 first. Command of the first type is given as *x* (<=-<=*n*<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*), where 0<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n* means all boys moves *x* girls in clockwise direction, while <=-<=*x* means all boys move *x* positions in counter-clockwise direction. There is no other input for commands of the second type.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput *n* integers, the *i*-th of them should be equal to the index of boy the *i*-th girl is dancing with after performing all *q* moves.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6 3\\n1 2\\n2\\n1 2\\n', '2 3\\n1 1\\n2\\n1 -2\\n', '4 2\\n2\\n1 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4 3 6 5 2 1\\n', '1 2\\n', '1 4 3 2\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Tyndex.Brome\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nTyndex is again well ahead of the rivals! The reaction to the release of Zoozle Chrome browser was the release of a new browser Tyndex.Brome!\n\nThe popularity of the new browser is growing daily. And the secret is not even the Tyndex.Bar installed (the Tyndex.Bar automatically fills the glass with the finest 1664 cognac after you buy Tyndex.Bottles and insert in into a USB port). It is highly popular due to the well-thought interaction with the user.\n\nLet us take, for example, the system of automatic address correction. Have you entered codehorses instead of codeforces? The gloomy Zoozle Chrome will sadly say that the address does not exist. Tyndex.Brome at the same time will automatically find the closest address and sent you there. That's brilliant!\n\nHow does this splendid function work? That's simple! For each potential address a function of the *F* error is calculated by the following rules:\n -  for every letter *c**i* from the potential address *c* the closest position *j* of the letter *c**i* in the address (*s*) entered by the user is found. The absolute difference |*i*<=-<=*j*| of these positions is added to *F*. So for every *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=|*c*|) the position *j* is chosen such, that *c**i*<==<=*s**j*, and |*i*<=-<=*j*| is minimal possible. -  if no such letter *c**i* exists in the address entered by the user, then the length of the potential address |*c*| is added to *F*. \nAfter the values of the error function have been calculated for all the potential addresses the most suitable one is found. \n\nTo understand the special features of the above described method better, it is recommended to realize the algorithm of calculating the *F* function for an address given by the user and some set of potential addresses. Good luck!\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=105). They are the number of potential addresses and the length of the address entered by the user. The next line contains *k* lowercase Latin letters. They are the address entered by the user (*s*). Each next *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) line contains a non-empty sequence of lowercase Latin letters. They are the potential address. It is guaranteed that the total length of all the lines does not exceed 2\u00b7105.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOn each *n* line of the output file print a single number: the value of the error function when the current potential address is chosen.\n\nPlease, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cout (also you may use %I64d).\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 10\\ncodeforces\\ncodeforces\\ncodehorses\\n', '9 9\\nvkontakte\\nvcontacte\\nvkontrakte\\nvkollapse\\nvkrokodile\\nvtopke\\nvkapuste\\nvpechke\\nvk\\nvcodeforcese\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0\\n12\\n', '18\\n14\\n36\\n47\\n14\\n29\\n30\\n0\\n84\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

This time the Beaver invites the contest participants to check out a problem on sorting documents by their subjects. Let's describe the problem:\n\nYou've got some training set of documents. For each document you know its subject. The subject in this problem is an integer from 1 to 3. Each of these numbers has a physical meaning. For instance, all documents with subject 3 are about trade.\n\nYou can download the training set of documents at the following link: http://download4.abbyy.com/a2/X2RZ2ZWXBG5VYWAL61H76ZQM/train.zip. The archive contains three directories with names \"1\", \"2\", \"3\". Directory named \"1\" contains documents on the 1-st subject, directory \"2\" contains documents on the 2-nd subject, and directory \"3\" contains documents on the 3-rd subject. Each document corresponds to exactly one file from some directory.\n\nAll documents have the following format: the first line contains the document identifier, the second line contains the name of the document, all subsequent lines contain the text of the document. The document identifier is used to make installing the problem more convenient and has no useful information for the participants.\n\nYou need to write a program that should indicate the subject for a given document. It is guaranteed that all documents given as input to your program correspond to one of the three subjects of the training set.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *id* (0<=\u2264<=*id*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 the document identifier. The second line contains the name of the document. The third and the subsequent lines contain the text of the document. It is guaranteed that the size of any given document will not exceed 10 kilobytes.\n\nThe tests for this problem are divided into 10 groups. Documents of groups 1 and 2 are taken from the training set, but their identifiers will not match the identifiers specified in the training set. Groups from the 3-rd to the 10-th are roughly sorted by the author in ascending order of difficulty (these groups contain documents which aren't present in the training set).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint an integer from 1 to 3, inclusive \u2014 the number of the subject the given document corresponds to.\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Kicker\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nKicker (table football) is a board game based on football, in which players control the footballers' figures mounted on rods by using bars to get the ball into the opponent's goal. When playing two on two, one player of each team controls the goalkeeper and the full-backs (plays defence), the other player controls the half-backs and forwards (plays attack).\n\nTwo teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the third and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the *i*-th player is *a**i*, the attack skill is *b**i*.\n\nBefore the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.\n\nWe will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.\n\nThe teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally. Identify the team that is guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that there is no such team.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input contain the players' description in four lines. The *i*-th line contains two space-separated integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the defence and the attack skill of the *i*-th player, correspondingly.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf the first team can win, print phrase \"Team 1\" (without the quotes), if the second team can win, print phrase \"Team 2\" (without the quotes). If no of the teams can definitely win, print \"Draw\" (without the quotes).\n\nDemo Input:\n['1 100\\n100 1\\n99 99\\n99 99\\n', '1 1\\n2 2\\n3 3\\n2 2\\n', '3 3\\n2 2\\n1 1\\n2 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['Team 1\\n', 'Team 2\\n', 'Draw\\n']\n\nNote:\nLet consider the first test sample. The first team can definitely win if it will choose the following arrangement: the first player plays attack, the second player plays defence.\n\nConsider the second sample. The order of the choosing roles for players makes sense in this sample. As the members of the first team choose first, the members of the second team can beat them (because they know the exact defence value and attack value of the first team).",

However, he doesn't know how to code and was unable to find the solution in the Internet, so he asks you to help.\n\nYou are given a sequence $a$, consisting of $n$ distinct integers, that is used to construct the binary search tree. Below is the formal description of the construction process.\n 1.  First element $a_1$ becomes the root of the tree. 1.  Elements $a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_n$ are added one by one. To add element $a_i$ one needs to traverse the tree starting from the root and using the following rules:   The pointer to the current node is set to the root. 1.  If $a_i$ is greater than the value in the current node, then its right child becomes the current node. Otherwise, the left child of the current node becomes the new current node. 1.  If at some point there is no required child, the new node is created, it is assigned value $a_i$ and becomes the corresponding child of the current node.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 100\\,000$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the sequence $a$.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ distinct integers $a_i$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the sequence $a$ itself.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput $n - 1$ integers.

Let's examine the presentation of this structure as follows:\n -  *employee* ::= *name*. | *name*:*employee*1,*employee*2, ... ,*employee**k*. -  *name* ::= name of an employee \nThat is, the description of each employee consists of his name, a colon (:), the descriptions of all his subordinates separated by commas, and, finally, a dot. If an employee has no subordinates, then the colon is not present in his description.\n\nFor example, line MIKE:MAX.,ARTEM:MIKE..,DMITRY:DMITRY.,DMITRY... is the correct way of recording the structure of a corporation where the director MIKE has subordinates MAX, ARTEM and DMITRY. ARTEM has a subordinate whose name is MIKE, just as the name of his boss and two subordinates of DMITRY are called DMITRY, just like himself.\n\nIn the Beroil corporation every employee can only correspond with his subordinates, at that the subordinates are not necessarily direct. Let's call an uncomfortable situation the situation when a person whose name is *s* writes a letter to another person whose name is also *s*. In the example given above are two such pairs: a pair involving MIKE, and two pairs for DMITRY (a pair for each of his subordinates).\n\nYour task is by the given structure of the corporation to find the number of uncomfortable pairs in it.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first and single line contains the corporation structure which is a string of length from 1 to 1000 characters. It is guaranteed that the description is correct. Every name is a string consisting of capital Latin letters from 1 to 10 symbols in length.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number \u2014 the number of uncomfortable situations in the company.\n\nDemo Input:\n['MIKE:MAX.,ARTEM:MIKE..,DMITRY:DMITRY.,DMITRY...\\n', 'A:A..\\n', 'A:C:C:C:C.....\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n', '1\\n', '6\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

Recently his mother has presented him one such array consisting of *n* elements. Petya is now wondering whether he can swap any two distinct integers in the array so that the array got unsorted. Please note that Petya can not swap equal integers even if they are in distinct positions in the array. Also note that Petya must swap some two integers even if the original array meets all requirements.\n\nArray *a* (the array elements are indexed from 1) consisting of *n* elements is called sorted if it meets at least one of the following two conditions:\n 1.  *a*1<=\u2264<=*a*2<=\u2264<=...<=\u2264<=*a**n*; 1.  *a*1<=\u2265<=*a*2<=\u2265<=...<=\u2265<=*a**n*. \nHelp Petya find the two required positions to swap or else say that they do not exist.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).

For example, it can move to the left and eat asterisk in position 5 (in 1 time unit) and then move from the position 5 to the right and eat asterisk in the position 7 (in 2 time units). So in 3 time units Packmen will eat all asterisks on the game field.\n\nIn the second example Packman in the position 4 will move to the left and after 2 time units will eat asterisks in positions 3 and 2. Packmen in positions 5 and 8 will move to the right and in 2 time units will eat asterisks in positions 7 and 10, respectively. So 2 time units is enough for Packmen to eat all asterisks on the game field.",

        "prompt": "Title: Biathlon\n\nTime Limit: 1 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nPerhaps many have heard that the World Biathlon Championship has finished. Although our hero Valera was not present at this spectacular event himself and only watched it on TV, it excited him so much that he decided to enroll in a biathlon section.\n\nOf course, biathlon as any sport, proved very difficult in practice. It takes much time and effort. Workouts, workouts, and workouts, \u2014 that's what awaited Valera on his way to great achievements in biathlon.\n\nAs for the workouts, you all probably know that every professional biathlete should ski fast and shoot precisely at the shooting range. Only in this case you can hope to be successful, because running and shooting are the two main components of biathlon. Valera has been diligent in his ski trainings, which is why he runs really fast, however, his shooting accuracy is nothing to write home about.\n\nOn a biathlon base where Valera is preparing for the competition, there is a huge rifle range with *n* targets. Each target have shape of a circle, and the center of each circle is located on the *Ox* axis. At the last training session Valera made the total of *m* shots. To make monitoring of his own results easier for him, one rather well-known programmer (of course it is you) was commissioned to write a program that would reveal how many and which targets Valera hit. More specifically, for each target the program must print the number of the first successful shot (in the target), or \"-1\" if this was not hit. The target is considered hit if the shot is inside the circle or on its boundary. Valera is counting on you and perhaps, thanks to you he will one day win international competitions.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input file contains the integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=104), which is the number of targets. The next *n* lines contain descriptions of the targets. Each target is a circle whose center is located on the *Ox* axis. Each circle is given by its coordinate of the center *x* (<=-<=2\u00b7104<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7104) and its radius *r* (1<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=1000). It is guaranteed that no two targets coincide, intersect or are nested into each other, but they can touch each other. \n\nThe next line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105), which is the number of shots. Next *m* lines contain descriptions of the shots, which are points on the plane, given by their coordinates *x* and *y* (<=-<=2\u00b7104<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7104).\n\nAll the numbers in the input are integers. \n\nTargets and shots are numbered starting from one in the order of the input.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint on the first line a single number, the number of targets hit by Valera. Print on the second line for each of the targets the number of its first hit or \"-1\" (without quotes) if this number does not exist. Separate numbers with spaces.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n2 1\\n5 2\\n10 1\\n5\\n0 1\\n1 3\\n3 0\\n4 0\\n4 0\\n', '3\\n3 2\\n7 1\\n11 2\\n4\\n2 1\\n6 0\\n6 4\\n11 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n3 3 -1 \\n', '3\\n1 2 4 \\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Bots\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nSasha and Ira are two best friends. But they aren\u2019t just friends, they are software engineers and experts in artificial intelligence. They are developing an algorithm for two bots playing a two-player game. The game is cooperative and turn based. In each turn, one of the players makes a move (it doesn\u2019t matter which player, it's possible that players turns do not alternate). \n\nAlgorithm for bots that Sasha and Ira are developing works by keeping track of the state the game is in. Each time either bot makes a move, the state changes. And, since the game is very dynamic, it will never go back to the state it was already in at any point in the past.\n\nSasha and Ira are perfectionists and want their algorithm to have an optimal winning strategy. They have noticed that in the optimal winning strategy, both bots make exactly *N* moves each. But, in order to find the optimal strategy, their algorithm needs to analyze all possible states of the game (they haven\u2019t learned about alpha-beta pruning yet) and pick the best sequence of moves.\n\nThey are worried about the efficiency of their algorithm and are wondering what is the total number of states of the game that need to be analyzed?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first and only line contains integer N.\n -  1<=\u2264<=*N*<=\u2264<=106\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput should contain a single integer \u2013 number of possible states modulo 109<=+<=7.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['19\\n']\n\nNote:\nStart: Game is in state A. \n -  Turn 1: Either bot can make a move (first bot is red and second bot is blue), so there are two possible states after the first turn \u2013 B and C. -  Turn 2: In both states B and C, either bot can again make a turn, so the list of possible states is expanded to include D, E, F and G. -  Turn 3: Red bot already did N=2 moves when in state D, so it cannot make any more moves there. It can make moves when in state E, F and G, so states I, K and M are added to the list. Similarly, blue bot cannot make a move when in state G, but can when in D, E and F, so states H, J and L are added. -  Turn 4: Red bot already did N=2 moves when in states H, I and K, so it can only make moves when in J, L and M, so states P, R and S are added. Blue bot cannot make a move when in states J, L and M, but only when in H, I and K, so states N, O and Q are added. \nOverall, there are 19 possible states of the game their algorithm needs to analyze.\n\n<img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/3d9ef2ab59018319b986a58a65362116fa5be88d.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>",

While playing he came up with an interesting question which he could not solve, can you please solve it for him?\n\nGiven an array consisting of distinct integers. Is it possible to partition the whole array into *k* disjoint non-empty parts such that *p* of the parts have even sum (each of them must have even sum) and remaining *k* - *p* have odd sum?

        "prompt": "Title: Quiz\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nManao is taking part in a quiz. The quiz consists of *n* consecutive questions. A correct answer gives one point to the player. The game also has a counter of consecutive correct answers. When the player answers a question correctly, the number on this counter increases by 1. If the player answers a question incorrectly, the counter is reset, that is, the number on it reduces to 0. If after an answer the counter reaches the number *k*, then it is reset, and the player's score is doubled. Note that in this case, first 1 point is added to the player's score, and then the total score is doubled. At the beginning of the game, both the player's score and the counter of consecutive correct answers are set to zero.\n\nManao remembers that he has answered exactly *m* questions correctly. But he does not remember the order in which the questions came. He's trying to figure out what his minimum score may be. Help him and compute the remainder of the corresponding number after division by 1000000009 (109<=+<=9).\n\nInput Specification:\nThe single line contains three space-separated integers *n*, *m* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109;\u00a00<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the remainder from division of Manao's minimum possible score in the quiz by 1000000009 (109<=+<=9).\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 3 2\\n', '5 4 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n', '6\\n']\n\nNote:\nSample 1. Manao answered 3 questions out of 5, and his score would double for each two consecutive correct answers. If Manao had answered the first, third and fifth questions, he would have scored as much as 3 points.\n\nSample 2. Now Manao answered 4 questions. The minimum possible score is obtained when the only wrong answer is to the question 4.\n\nAlso note that you are asked to minimize the score and not the remainder of the score modulo 1000000009. For example, if Manao could obtain either 2000000000 or 2000000020 points, the answer is 2000000000\u00a0*mod*\u00a01000000009, even though 2000000020\u00a0*mod*\u00a01000000009 is a smaller number.",

        "prompt": "Title: Zebras\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOleg writes down the history of the days he lived. For each day he decides if it was good or bad. Oleg calls a non-empty sequence of days a zebra, if it starts with a bad day, ends with a bad day, and good and bad days are alternating in it. Let us denote bad days as 0 and good days as 1. Then, for example, sequences of days 0, 010, 01010 are zebras, while sequences 1, 0110, 0101 are not.\n\nOleg tells you the story of days he lived in chronological order in form of string consisting of 0 and 1. Now you are interested if it is possible to divide Oleg's life history into several subsequences, each of which is a zebra, and the way it can be done. Each day must belong to exactly one of the subsequences. For each of the subsequences, days forming it must be ordered chronologically. Note that subsequence does not have to be a group of consecutive days.\n\nInput Specification:\nIn the only line of input data there is a non-empty string *s* consisting of characters 0 and 1, which describes the history of Oleg's life. Its length (denoted as |*s*|) does not exceed 200<=000 characters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf there is a way to divide history into zebra subsequences, in the first line of output you should print an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=|*s*|), the resulting number of subsequences. In the *i*-th of following *k* lines first print the integer *l**i* (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=|*s*|), which is the length of the *i*-th subsequence, and then *l**i* indices of days forming the subsequence. Indices must follow in ascending order. Days are numbered starting from 1. Each index from 1 to *n* must belong to exactly one subsequence. If there is no way to divide day history into zebra subsequences, print -1.\n\nSubsequences may be printed in any order. If there are several solutions, you may print any of them. You do not have to minimize nor maximize the value of *k*.\n\nDemo Input:\n['0010100\\n', '111\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n3 1 3 4\\n3 2 5 6\\n1 7\\n', '-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
