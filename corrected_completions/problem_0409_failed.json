  "prompt": "Title: Producing Snow\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nAlice likes snow a lot! Unfortunately, this year's winter is already over, and she can't expect to have any more of it. Bob has thus bought her a gift — a large snow maker. He plans to make some amount of snow every day. On day *i* he will make a pile of snow of volume *V**i* and put it in her garden.\n\nEach day, every pile will shrink a little due to melting. More precisely, when the temperature on a given day is *T**i*, each pile will reduce its volume by *T**i*. If this would reduce the volume of a pile to or below zero, it disappears forever. All snow piles are independent of each other. \n\nNote that the pile made on day *i* already loses part of its volume on the same day. In an extreme case, this may mean that there are no piles left at the end of a particular day.\n\nYou are given the initial pile sizes and the temperature on each day. Determine the total volume of snow melted on each day.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *N* (1<=≤<=*N*<=≤<=105) — the number of days. \n\nThe second line contains *N* integers *V*1,<=*V*2,<=...,<=*V**N* (0<=≤<=*V**i*<=≤<=109), where *V**i* is the initial size of a snow pile made on the day *i*.\n\nThe third line contains *N* integers *T*1,<=*T*2,<=...,<=*T**N* (0<=≤<=*T**i*<=≤<=109), where *T**i* is the temperature on the day *i*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput a single line with *N* integers, where the *i*-th integer represents the total volume of snow melted on day *i*.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n10 10 5\\n5 7 2\\n', '5\\n30 25 20 15 10\\n9 10 12 4 13\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['5 12 4\\n', '9 20 35 11 25\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, Bob first makes a snow pile of volume 10, which melts to the size of 5 on the same day. On the second day, he makes another pile of size 10. Since it is a bit warmer than the day before, the first pile disappears completely while the second pile shrinks to 3. At the end of the second day, he has only a single pile of size 3. On the third day he makes a smaller pile than usual, but as the temperature dropped too, both piles survive till the end of the day.",
