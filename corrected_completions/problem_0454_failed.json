  "prompt": "Title: ZgukistringZ\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nProfessor GukiZ doesn't accept string as they are. He likes to swap some letters in string to obtain a new one.\n\nGukiZ has strings *a*, *b*, and *c*. He wants to obtain string *k* by swapping some letters in *a*, so that *k* should contain as many non-overlapping substrings equal either to *b* or *c* as possible. Substring of string *x* is a string formed by consecutive segment of characters from *x*. Two substrings of string *x* overlap if there is position *i* in string *x* occupied by both of them.\n\nGukiZ was disappointed because none of his students managed to solve the problem. Can you help them and find one of possible strings *k*?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains string *a*, the second line contains string *b*, and the third line contains string *c* (1<=≤<=|*a*|,<=|*b*|,<=|*c*|<=≤<=105, where |*s*| denotes the length of string *s*).\n\nAll three strings consist only of lowercase English letters. \n\nIt is possible that *b* and *c* coincide.\n\nOutput Specification:\nFind one of possible strings *k*, as described in the problem statement. If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['aaa\\na\\nb\\n', 'pozdravstaklenidodiri\\nniste\\ndobri\\n', 'abbbaaccca\\nab\\naca\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['aaa', 'nisteaadddiiklooprrvz', 'ababacabcc']\n\nNote:\nIn the third sample, this optimal solutions has three non-overlaping substrings equal to either *b* or *c* on positions 1 – 2 (*ab*), 3 – 4 (*ab*), 5 – 7 (*aca*). In this sample, there exist many other optimal solutions, one of them would be *acaababbcc*.",
