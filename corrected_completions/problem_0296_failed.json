  "prompt": "Title: Fix a Tree\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nA tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles.\n\nLet's consider a rooted undirected tree with *n* vertices, numbered 1 through *n*. There are many ways to represent such a tree. One way is to create an array with *n* integers *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*, where *p**i* denotes a parent of vertex *i* (here, for convenience a root is considered its own parent).\n\nGiven a sequence *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*, one is able to restore a tree:\n 1.  There must be exactly one index *r* that *p**r*<==<=*r*. A vertex *r* is a root of the tree. 1.  For all other *n*<=-<=1 vertices *i*, there is an edge between vertex *i* and vertex *p**i*. \nA sequence *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* is called valid if the described procedure generates some (any) rooted tree. For example, for *n*<==<=3 sequences (1,2,2), (2,3,1) and (2,1,3) are not valid.\n\nYou are given a sequence *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, not necessarily valid. Your task is to change the minimum number of elements, in order to get a valid sequence. Print the minimum number of changes and an example of a valid sequence after that number of changes. If there are many valid sequences achievable in the minimum number of changes, print any of them.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains an integer *n* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=200<=000) — the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=*n*).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print the minimum number of elements to change, in order to get a valid sequence.\n\nIn the second line, print any valid sequence possible to get from (*a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*) in the minimum number of changes. If there are many such sequences, any of them will be accepted.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n2 3 3 4\\n', '5\\n3 2 2 5 3\\n', '8\\n2 3 5 4 1 6 6 7\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n2 3 4 4 \\n', '0\\n3 2 2 5 3 \\n', '2\\n2 3 7 8 1 6 6 7\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, it's enough to change one element. In the provided output, a sequence represents a tree rooted in a vertex 4 (because *p*<sub class=\"lower-index\">4</sub> = 4), which you can see on the left drawing below. One of other correct solutions would be a sequence 2 3 3 2, representing a tree rooted in vertex 3 (right drawing below). On both drawings, roots are painted red.\n\nIn the second sample, the given sequence is already valid.",
