  "prompt": "Title: Anton and Lines\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe teacher gave Anton a large geometry homework, but he didn't do it (as usual) as he participated in a regular round on Codeforces. In the task he was given a set of *n* lines defined by the equations *y*<==<=*k**i*·*x*<=+<=*b**i*. It was necessary to determine whether there is at least one point of intersection of two of these lines, that lays strictly inside the strip between *x*1<=&lt;<=*x*2. In other words, is it true that there are 1<=≤<=*i*<=&lt;<=*j*<=≤<=*n* and *x*',<=*y*', such that: \n -  *y*'<==<=*k**i*<=*<=*x*'<=+<=*b**i*, that is, point (*x*',<=*y*') belongs to the line number *i*; -  *y*'<==<=*k**j*<=*<=*x*'<=+<=*b**j*, that is, point (*x*',<=*y*') belongs to the line number *j*; -  *x*1<=&lt;<=*x*'<=&lt;<=*x*2, that is, point (*x*',<=*y*') lies inside the strip bounded by *x*1<=&lt;<=*x*2. \nYou can't leave Anton in trouble, can you? Write a program that solves the given task.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains an integer *n* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100<=000) — the number of lines in the task given to Anton. The second line contains integers *x*1 and *x*2 (<=-<=1<=000<=000<=≤<=*x*1<=&lt;<=*x*2<=≤<=1<=000<=000) defining the strip inside which you need to find a point of intersection of at least two lines.\n\nThe following *n* lines contain integers *k**i*, *b**i* (<=-<=1<=000<=000<=≤<=*k**i*,<=*b**i*<=≤<=1<=000<=000) — the descriptions of the lines. It is guaranteed that all lines are pairwise distinct, that is, for any two *i*<=≠<=*j* it is true that either *k**i*<=≠<=*k**j*, or *b**i*<=≠<=*b**j*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint \"Yes\" (without quotes), if there is at least one intersection of two distinct lines, located strictly inside the strip. Otherwise print \"No\" (without quotes).\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n1 2\\n1 2\\n1 0\\n0 1\\n0 2\\n', '2\\n1 3\\n1 0\\n-1 3\\n', '2\\n1 3\\n1 0\\n0 2\\n', '2\\n1 3\\n1 0\\n0 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['NO', 'YES', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample there are intersections located on the border of the strip, but there are no intersections located strictly inside it.",
