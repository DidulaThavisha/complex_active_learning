  "prompt": "Title: Pavel and barbecue\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nPavel cooks barbecue. There are *n* skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of *n* positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of *n* positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.\n\nPavel has a plan: a permutation *p* and a sequence *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n*, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position *i* to position *p**i*, and if *b**i* equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.\n\nUnfortunately, not every pair of permutation *p* and sequence *b* suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation *p* and the given sequence *b* he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2*n* placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.\n\nThere is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation *p* and a sequence *b* suit him if there is an integer *k* (*k*<=≥<=2*n*), so that after *k* seconds each skewer visits each of the 2*n* placements.\n\nIt can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation *p* and sequence *b* exists for any *n*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contain the integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=2·105) — the number of skewers.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* (1<=≤<=*p**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.\n\nThe third line contains a sequence *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n* consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation *p* and the given sequence *b* he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2*n* placements.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n4 3 2 1\\n0 1 1 1\\n', '3\\n2 3 1\\n0 0 0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '1\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2.\n\nIn the second example Pavel can change any element of *b* to 1.",
