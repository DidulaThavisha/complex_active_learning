  "prompt": "Title: Terse princess\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\n«Next please», — the princess called and cast an estimating glance at the next groom.\n\nThe princess intends to choose the most worthy groom, this is, the richest one. Whenever she sees a groom who is more rich than each of the previous ones, she says a measured «Oh...». Whenever the groom is richer than all previous ones added together, she exclaims «Wow!» (no «Oh...» in this case). At the sight of the first groom the princess stays calm and says nothing.\n\nThe fortune of each groom is described with an integer between 1 and 50000. You know that during the day the princess saw *n* grooms, said «Oh...» exactly *a* times and exclaimed «Wow!» exactly *b* times. Your task is to output a sequence of *n* integers *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n*, where *t**i* describes the fortune of *i*-th groom. If several sequences are possible, output any of them. If no sequence exists that would satisfy all the requirements, output a single number -1.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe only line of input data contains three integer numbers *n*,<=*a* and *b* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100,<=0<=≤<=*a*,<=*b*<=≤<=15,<=*n*<=&gt;<=*a*<=+<=*b*), separated with single spaces.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput any sequence of integers *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n*, where *t**i* (1<=≤<=*t**i*<=≤<=50000) is the fortune of *i*-th groom, that satisfies the given constraints. If no sequence exists that would satisfy all the requirements, output a single number -1.\n\nDemo Input:\n['10 2 3\\n', '5 0 0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['5 1 3 6 16 35 46 4 200 99', '10 10 6 6 5']\n\nNote:\nLet's have a closer look at the answer for the first sample test. \n -  The princess said «Oh...» (highlighted in bold): 5 1 3 6 16 35 46 4 200 99. -  The princess exclaimed «Wow!» (highlighted in bold): 5 1 3 6 16 35 46 4 200 99.",
