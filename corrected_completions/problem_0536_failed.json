  "prompt": "Title: Equivalent Strings\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nToday on a lecture about strings Gerald learned a new definition of string equivalency. Two strings *a* and *b* of equal length are called equivalent in one of the two cases: \n 1.  They are equal. 1.  If we split string *a* into two halves of the same size *a*1 and *a*2, and string *b* into two halves of the same size *b*1 and *b*2, then one of the following is correct:   *a*1 is equivalent to *b*1, and *a*2 is equivalent to *b*2 1.  *a*1 is equivalent to *b*2, and *a*2 is equivalent to *b*1 \nAs a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent.\n\nGerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first two lines of the input contain two strings given by the teacher. Each of them has the length from 1 to 200<=000 and consists of lowercase English letters. The strings have the same length.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint \"YES\" (without the quotes), if these two strings are equivalent, and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\n\nDemo Input:\n['aaba\\nabaa\\n', 'aabb\\nabab\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample you should split the first string into strings \"aa\" and \"ba\", the second one — into strings \"ab\" and \"aa\". \"aa\" is equivalent to \"aa\"; \"ab\" is equivalent to \"ba\" as \"ab\" = \"a\" + \"b\", \"ba\" = \"b\" + \"a\".\n\nIn the second sample the first string can be splitted into strings \"aa\" and \"bb\", that are equivalent only to themselves. That's why string \"aabb\" is equivalent only to itself and to string \"bbaa\".",
