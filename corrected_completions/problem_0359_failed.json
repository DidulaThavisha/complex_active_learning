  "prompt": "Title: Replacement\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nDaniel has a string *s*, consisting of lowercase English letters and period signs (characters '.'). Let's define the operation of replacement as the following sequence of steps: find a substring \"..\" (two consecutive periods) in string *s*, of all occurrences of the substring let's choose the first one, and replace this substring with string \".\". In other words, during the replacement operation, the first two consecutive periods are replaced by one. If string *s* contains no two consecutive periods, then nothing happens.\n\nLet's define *f*(*s*) as the minimum number of operations of replacement to perform, so that the string does not have any two consecutive periods left.\n\nYou need to process *m* queries, the *i*-th results in that the character at position *x**i* (1<=≤<=*x**i*<=≤<=*n*) of string *s* is assigned value *c**i*. After each operation you have to calculate and output the value of *f*(*s*).\n\nHelp Daniel to process all queries.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=300<=000) the length of the string and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains string *s*, consisting of *n* lowercase English letters and period signs.\n\nThe following *m* lines contain the descriptions of queries. The *i*-th line contains integer *x**i* and *c**i* (1<=≤<=*x**i*<=≤<=*n*, *c**i* — a lowercas English letter or a period sign), describing the query of assigning symbol *c**i* to position *x**i*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *m* numbers, one per line, the *i*-th of these numbers must be equal to the value of *f*(*s*) after performing the *i*-th assignment.\n\nDemo Input:\n['10 3\\n.b..bz....\\n1 h\\n3 c\\n9 f\\n', '4 4\\n.cc.\\n2 .\\n3 .\\n2 a\\n1 a\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4\\n3\\n1\\n', '1\\n3\\n1\\n1\\n']\n\nNote:\nNote to the first sample test (replaced periods are enclosed in square brackets).\n\nThe original string is \".b..bz....\".\n-  after the first query *f*(hb..bz....) = 4    (\"hb[..]bz....\"  →  \"hb.bz[..]..\"  →  \"hb.bz[..].\"  →  \"hb.bz[..]\"  →  \"hb.bz.\")-  after the second query *f*(hbс.bz....) = 3    (\"hbс.bz[..]..\"  →  \"hbс.bz[..].\"  →  \"hbс.bz[..]\"  →  \"hbс.bz.\")-  after the third query *f*(hbс.bz..f.) = 1    (\"hbс.bz[..]f.\"  →  \"hbс.bz.f.\")\nNote to the second sample test.\n\nThe original string is \".cc.\".\n-  after the first query: *f*(..c.) = 1    (\"[..]c.\"  →  \".c.\")-  after the second query: *f*(....) = 3    (\"[..]..\"  →  \"[..].\"  →  \"[..]\"  →  \".\")-  after the third query: *f*(.a..) = 1    (\".a[..]\"  →  \".a.\")-  after the fourth query: *f*(aa..) = 1    (\"aa[..]\"  →  \"aa.\")",
