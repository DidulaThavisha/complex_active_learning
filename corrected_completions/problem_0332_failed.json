  "prompt": "Title: Bear and Blocks\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nLimak is a little bear who loves to play. Today he is playing by destroying block towers. He built *n* towers in a row. The *i*-th tower is made of *h**i* identical blocks. For clarification see picture for the first sample.\n\nLimak will repeat the following operation till everything is destroyed.\n\nBlock is called internal if it has all four neighbors, i.e. it has each side (top, left, down and right) adjacent to other block or to the floor. Otherwise, block is boundary. In one operation Limak destroys all boundary blocks. His paws are very fast and he destroys all those blocks at the same time.\n\nLimak is ready to start. You task is to count how many operations will it take him to destroy all towers.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains single integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105).\n\nThe second line contains *n* space-separated integers *h*1,<=*h*2,<=...,<=*h**n* (1<=≤<=*h**i*<=≤<=109) — sizes of towers.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the number of operations needed to destroy all towers.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6\\n2 1 4 6 2 2\\n', '7\\n3 3 3 1 3 3 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n', '2\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe picture below shows all three operations for the first sample test. Each time boundary blocks are marked with red color.",
