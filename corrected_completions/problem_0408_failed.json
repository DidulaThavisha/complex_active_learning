  "prompt": "Title: The Labyrinth\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nYou are given a rectangular field of *n*<=×<=*m* cells. Each cell is either empty or impassable (contains an obstacle). Empty cells are marked with '.', impassable cells are marked with '*'. Let's call two empty cells adjacent if they share a side.\n\nLet's call a connected component any non-extendible set of cells such that any two of them are connected by the path of adjacent cells. It is a typical well-known definition of a connected component.\n\nFor each impassable cell (*x*,<=*y*) imagine that it is an empty cell (all other cells remain unchanged) and find the size (the number of cells) of the connected component which contains (*x*,<=*y*). You should do it for each impassable cell independently.\n\nThe answer should be printed as a matrix with *n* rows and *m* columns. The *j*-th symbol of the *i*-th row should be \".\" if the cell is empty at the start. Otherwise the *j*-th symbol of the *i*-th row should contain the only digit —- the answer modulo 10. The matrix should be printed without any spaces.\n\nTo make your output faster it is recommended to build the output as an array of *n* strings having length *m* and print it as a sequence of lines. It will be much faster than writing character-by-character.\n\nAs input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n*,<=*m* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=1000) — the number of rows and columns in the field.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains *m* symbols: \".\" for empty cells, \"*\" for impassable cells.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the answer as a matrix as described above. See the examples to precise the format of the output.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 3\\n*.*\\n.*.\\n*.*\\n', '4 5\\n**..*\\n..***\\n.*.*.\\n*.*.*\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3.3\\n.5.\\n3.3\\n', '46..3\\n..732\\n.6.4.\\n5.4.3\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn first example, if we imagine that the central cell is empty then it will be included to component of size 5 (cross). If any of the corner cell will be empty then it will be included to component of size 3 (corner).",
