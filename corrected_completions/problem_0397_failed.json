  "prompt": "Title: Dreamoon and Sums\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nDreamoon loves summing up something for no reason. One day he obtains two integers *a* and *b* occasionally. He wants to calculate the sum of all nice integers. Positive integer *x* is called nice if  and , where *k* is some integer number in range [1,<=*a*].\n\nBy  we denote the quotient of integer division of *x* and *y*. By  we denote the remainder of integer division of *x* and *y*. You can read more about these operations here: http://goo.gl/AcsXhT.\n\nThe answer may be large, so please print its remainder modulo 1<=000<=000<=007 (109<=+<=7). Can you compute it faster than Dreamoon?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe single line of the input contains two integers *a*, *b* (1<=≤<=*a*,<=*b*<=≤<=107).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer representing the answer modulo 1<=000<=000<=007 (109<=+<=7).\n\nDemo Input:\n['1 1\\n', '2 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0\\n', '8\\n']\n\nNote:\nFor the first sample, there are no nice integers because <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/03b1dc6bae5180f8a2d8eb85789e8b393e585970.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> is always zero.\n\nFor the second sample, the set of nice integers is {3, 5}.",
