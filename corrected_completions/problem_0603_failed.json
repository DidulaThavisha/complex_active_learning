  "prompt": "Title: Restore Graph\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nValera had an undirected connected graph without self-loops and multiple edges consisting of *n* vertices. The graph had an interesting property: there were at most *k* edges adjacent to each of its vertices. For convenience, we will assume that the graph vertices were indexed by integers from 1 to *n*.\n\nOne day Valera counted the shortest distances from one of the graph vertices to all other ones and wrote them out in array *d*. Thus, element *d*[*i*] of the array shows the shortest distance from the vertex Valera chose to vertex number *i*.\n\nThen something irreparable terrible happened. Valera lost the initial graph. However, he still has the array *d*. Help him restore the lost graph.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *k* (1<=≤<=*k*<=&lt;<=*n*<=≤<=105). Number *n* shows the number of vertices in the original graph. Number *k* shows that at most *k* edges were adjacent to each vertex in the original graph.\n\nThe second line contains space-separated integers *d*[1],<=*d*[2],<=...,<=*d*[*n*] (0<=≤<=*d*[*i*]<=&lt;<=*n*). Number *d*[*i*] shows the shortest distance from the vertex Valera chose to the vertex number *i*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf Valera made a mistake in his notes and the required graph doesn't exist, print in the first line number -1. Otherwise, in the first line print integer *m* (0<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=106) — the number of edges in the found graph.\n\nIn each of the next *m* lines print two space-separated integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=≤<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=≤<=*n*; *a**i*<=≠<=*b**i*), denoting the edge that connects vertices with numbers *a**i* and *b**i*. The graph shouldn't contain self-loops and multiple edges. If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 2\\n0 1 1\\n', '4 2\\n2 0 1 3\\n', '3 1\\n0 0 0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n3 2\\n', '3\\n1 3\\n1 4\\n2 3\\n', '-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
