  "prompt": "Title: Clear Symmetry\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nConsider some square matrix *A* with side *n* consisting of zeros and ones. There are *n* rows numbered from 1 to *n* from top to bottom and *n* columns numbered from 1 to *n* from left to right in this matrix. We'll denote the element of the matrix which is located at the intersection of the *i*-row and the *j*-th column as *A**i*,<=*j*.\n\nLet's call matrix *A* clear if no two cells containing ones have a common side.\n\nLet's call matrix *A* symmetrical if it matches the matrices formed from it by a horizontal and/or a vertical reflection. Formally, for each pair (*i*,<=*j*) (1<=≤<=*i*,<=*j*<=≤<=*n*) both of the following conditions must be met: *A**i*,<=*j*<==<=*A**n*<=-<=*i*<=+<=1,<=*j* and *A**i*,<=*j*<==<=*A**i*,<=*n*<=-<=*j*<=+<=1.\n\nLet's define the sharpness of matrix *A* as the number of ones in it.\n\nGiven integer *x*, your task is to find the smallest positive integer *n* such that there exists a clear symmetrical matrix *A* with side *n* and sharpness *x*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe only line contains a single integer *x* (1<=≤<=*x*<=≤<=100) — the required sharpness of the matrix.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number — the sought value of *n*.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n', '9\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n', '5\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe figure below shows the matrices that correspond to the samples:",
