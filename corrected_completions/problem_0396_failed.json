  "prompt": "Title: Toda 2\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nA group of *n* friends enjoys playing popular video game Toda 2. There is a rating system describing skill level of each player, initially the rating of the *i*-th friend is *r**i*.\n\nThe friends decided to take part in the championship as a team. But they should have equal ratings to be allowed to compose a single team consisting of all *n* friends. So the friends are faced with the problem: how to make all their ratings equal.\n\nOne way to change ratings is to willingly lose in some matches. Friends can form a party consisting of two to five (but not more than *n*) friends and play a match in the game. When the party loses, the rating of each of its members decreases by 1. A rating can't become negative, so *r**i*<==<=0 doesn't change after losing.\n\nThe friends can take part in multiple matches, each time making a party from any subset of friends (but remember about constraints on party size: from 2 to 5 members).\n\nThe friends want to make their ratings equal but as high as possible.\n\nHelp the friends develop a strategy of losing the matches so that all their ratings become equal and the resulting rating is maximum possible.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) — the number of friends.\n\nThe second line contains *n* non-negative integers *r*1,<=*r*2,<=...,<=*r**n* (0<=≤<=*r**i*<=≤<=100), where *r**i* is the initial rating of the *i*-th friend.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line, print a single integer *R* — the final rating of each of the friends.\n\nIn the second line, print integer *t* — the number of matches the friends have to play. Each of the following *t* lines should contain *n* characters '0' or '1', where the *j*-th character of the *i*-th line is equal to:\n -  '0', if friend *j* should not play in match *i*, -  '1', if friend *j* should play in match *i*. \nEach line should contain between two and five characters '1', inclusive.\n\nThe value *t* should not exceed 104, it is guaranteed that such solution exists. \n\nRemember that you shouldn't minimize the value *t*, but you should maximize *R*. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5\\n4 5 1 7 4\\n', '2\\n1 2\\n', '3\\n1 1 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n8\\n01010\\n00011\\n01010\\n10010\\n00011\\n11000\\n00011\\n11000\\n', '0\\n2\\n11\\n11\\n', '1\\n0\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
