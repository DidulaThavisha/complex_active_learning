Alice knows that the only theoretically secure cipher is one-time pad. Alice generates a random key *K* of the length equal to the message's length. Alice computes the bitwise xor of each element of the message and the key (, where  denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR)) and stores this encrypted message *A*. Alice is smart. Be like Alice.\n\nFor example, Alice may have wanted to store a message *M*<==<=(0,<=15,<=9,<=18). She generated a key *K*<==<=(16,<=7,<=6,<=3). The encrypted message is thus *A*<==<=(16,<=8,<=15,<=17).\n\nAlice realised that she cannot store the key with the encrypted message. Alice sent her key *K* to Bob and deleted her own copy. Alice is smart. Really, be like Alice.\n\nBob realised that the encrypted message is only secure as long as the key is secret. Bob thus randomly permuted the key before storing it. Bob thinks that this way, even if Eve gets both the encrypted message and the key, she will not be able to read the message. Bob is not smart. Don't be like Bob.\n\nIn the above example, Bob may have, for instance, selected a permutation (3,<=4,<=1,<=2) and stored the permuted key *P*<==<=(6,<=3,<=16,<=7).\n\nOne year has passed and Alice wants to decrypt her message. Only now Bob has realised that this is impossible. As he has permuted the key randomly, the message is lost forever. Did we mention that Bob isn't smart?\n\nBob wants to salvage at least some information from the message. Since he is not so smart, he asks for your help. You know the encrypted message *A* and the permuted key *P*. What is the lexicographically smallest message that could have resulted in the given encrypted text?\n\nMore precisely, for given *A* and *P*, find the lexicographically smallest message *O*, for which there exists a permutation π such that  for every *i*.\n\nNote that the sequence *S* is lexicographically smaller than the sequence *T*, if there is an index *i* such that *S**i*<=&lt;<=*T**i* and for all *j*<=&lt;<=*i* the condition *S**j*<==<=*T**j* holds.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *N* (1<=≤<=*N*<=≤<=300000), the length of the message. \n\nThe second line contains *N* integers *A*1,<=*A*2,<=...,<=*A**N* (0<=≤<=*A**i*<=&lt;<=230) representing the encrypted message.\n\nThe third line contains *N* integers *P*1,<=*P*2,<=...,<=*P**N* (0<=≤<=*P**i*<=&lt;<=230) representing the permuted encryption key.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput a single line with *N* integers, the lexicographically smallest possible message *O*. Note that all its elements should be non-negative.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n8 4 13\\n17 2 7\\n', '5\\n12 7 87 22 11\\n18 39 9 12 16\\n', '10\\n331415699 278745619 998190004 423175621 42983144 166555524 843586353 802130100 337889448 685310951\\n226011312 266003835 342809544 504667531 529814910 684873393 817026985 844010788 993949858 1031395667\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['10 3 28\\n', '0 14 69 6 44\\n', '128965467 243912600 4281110 112029883 223689619 76924724 429589 119397893 613490433 362863284\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first case, the solution is (10, 3, 28), since <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/a896b30a69636d1bfbfa981eae10650f5fee843c.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/e383e4333ea37c4652ce2ac1ccfc2cfcf96e0896.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> and <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/c24ed3c6f88805eb3710487b3fe07ff64034151a.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.
