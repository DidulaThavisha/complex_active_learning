  "prompt": "Title: Guard Duty (easy)\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe Rebel fleet is afraid that the Empire might want to strike back again. Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign *R* Rebel spaceships to guard *B* bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers *R*,<=*B*(1<=≤<=*R*,<=*B*<=≤<=10). For 1<=≤<=*i*<=≤<=*R*, the *i*<=+<=1-th line contains two space-separated integers *x**i* and *y**i* (|*x**i*|,<=|*y**i*|<=≤<=10000) denoting the coordinates of the *i*-th Rebel spaceship. The following *B* lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2\\n', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['Yes\\n', 'No\\n']\n\nNote:\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.\n\nFor the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.",
