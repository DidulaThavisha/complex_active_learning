  "prompt": "Title: Right Triangles\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nYou are given a *n*<=×<=*m* field consisting only of periods ('.') and asterisks ('*'). Your task is to count all right triangles with two sides parallel to the square sides, whose vertices are in the centers of '*'-cells. A right triangle is a triangle in which one angle is a right angle (that is, a 90 degree angle).\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two positive integer numbers *n* and *m* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=1000). The following *n* lines consist of *m* characters each, describing the field. Only '.' and '*' are allowed.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput a single number — total number of square triangles in the field. Please, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cout (also you may use %I64d).\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 2\\n**\\n*.\\n', '3 4\\n*..*\\n.**.\\n*.**\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '9\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
