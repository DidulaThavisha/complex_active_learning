  "prompt": "Title: Dasha and Very Difficult Problem\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nDasha logged into the system and began to solve problems. One of them is as follows:\n\nGiven two sequences *a* and *b* of length *n* each you need to write a sequence *c* of length *n*, the *i*-th element of which is calculated as follows: *c**i*<==<=*b**i*<=-<=*a**i*.\n\nAbout sequences *a* and *b* we know that their elements are in the range from *l* to *r*. More formally, elements satisfy the following conditions: *l*<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=*r* and *l*<=≤<=*b**i*<=≤<=*r*. About sequence *c* we know that all its elements are distinct.\n\nDasha wrote a solution to that problem quickly, but checking her work on the standard test was not so easy. Due to an error in the test system only the sequence *a* and the compressed sequence of the sequence *c* were known from that test.\n\nLet's give the definition to a compressed sequence. A compressed sequence of sequence *c* of length *n* is a sequence *p* of length *n*, so that *p**i* equals to the number of integers which are less than or equal to *c**i* in the sequence *c*. For example, for the sequence *c*<==<=[250,<=200,<=300,<=100,<=50] the compressed sequence will be *p*<==<=[4,<=3,<=5,<=2,<=1]. Pay attention that in *c* all integers are distinct. Consequently, the compressed sequence contains all integers from 1 to *n* inclusively.\n\nHelp Dasha to find any sequence *b* for which the calculated compressed sequence of sequence *c* is correct.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *l*, *r* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105,<=1<=≤<=*l*<=≤<=*r*<=≤<=109) — the length of the sequence and boundaries of the segment where the elements of sequences *a* and *b* are.\n\nThe next line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=<=*a*2,<=<=...,<=<=*a**n* (*l*<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=*r*) — the elements of the sequence *a*.\n\nThe next line contains *n* distinct integers *p*1,<=<=*p*2,<=<=...,<=<=*p**n* (1<=≤<=*p**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the compressed sequence of the sequence *c*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf there is no the suitable sequence *b*, then in the only line print \"-1\".\n\nOtherwise, in the only line print *n* integers — the elements of any suitable sequence *b*.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 1 5\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n3 1 5 4 2\\n', '4 2 9\\n3 4 8 9\\n3 2 1 4\\n', '6 1 5\\n1 1 1 1 1 1\\n2 3 5 4 1 6\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3 1 5 4 2 ', '2 2 2 9 ', '-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nSequence *b* which was found in the second sample is suitable, because calculated sequence *c* = [2 - 3, 2 - 4, 2 - 8, 9 - 9] = [ - 1,  - 2,  - 6, 0] (note that *c*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub> = *b*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub> - *a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub>) has compressed sequence equals to *p* = [3, 2, 1, 4].",
