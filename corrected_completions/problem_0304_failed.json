  "prompt": "Title: pSort\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOne day *n* cells of some array decided to play the following game. Initially each cell contains a number which is equal to it's ordinal number (starting from 1). Also each cell determined it's favourite number. On it's move *i*-th cell can exchange it's value with the value of some other *j*-th cell, if |*i*<=-<=*j*|<==<=*d**i*, where *d**i* is a favourite number of *i*-th cell. Cells make moves in any order, the number of moves is unlimited.\n\nThe favourite number of each cell will be given to you. You will also be given a permutation of numbers from 1 to *n*. You are to determine whether the game could move to this state.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains positive integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) — the number of cells in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct integers from 1 to *n* — permutation. The last line contains *n* integers from 1 to *n* — favourite numbers of the cells.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf the given state is reachable in the described game, output YES, otherwise NO.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5\\n5 4 3 2 1\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n', '7\\n4 3 5 1 2 7 6\\n4 6 6 1 6 6 1\\n', '7\\n4 2 5 1 3 7 6\\n4 6 6 1 6 6 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
