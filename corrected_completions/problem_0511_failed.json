  "prompt": "Title: Distance in Tree\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nA tree is a connected graph that doesn't contain any cycles.\n\nThe distance between two vertices of a tree is the length (in edges) of the shortest path between these vertices.\n\nYou are given a tree with *n* vertices and a positive number *k*. Find the number of distinct pairs of the vertices which have a distance of exactly *k* between them. Note that pairs (*v*, *u*) and (*u*, *v*) are considered to be the same pair.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=50000, 1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=500) — the number of vertices and the required distance between the vertices.\n\nNext *n*<=-<=1 lines describe the edges as \"*a**i* *b**i*\" (without the quotes) (1<=≤<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=≤<=*n*, *a**i*<=≠<=*b**i*), where *a**i* and *b**i* are the vertices connected by the *i*-th edge. All given edges are different.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer — the number of distinct pairs of the tree's vertices which have a distance of exactly *k* between them.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 2\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n2 5\\n', '5 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n4 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4\\n', '2\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample the pairs of vertexes at distance 2 from each other are (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 5) and (2, 4).",
