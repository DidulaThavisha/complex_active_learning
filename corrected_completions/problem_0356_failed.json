  "prompt": "Title: Short Program\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nPetya learned a new programming language CALPAS. A program in this language always takes one non-negative integer and returns one non-negative integer as well.\n\nIn the language, there are only three commands: apply a bitwise operation AND, OR or XOR with a given constant to the current integer. A program can contain an arbitrary sequence of these operations with arbitrary constants from 0 to 1023. When the program is run, all operations are applied (in the given order) to the argument and in the end the result integer is returned.\n\nPetya wrote a program in this language, but it turned out to be too long. Write a program in CALPAS that does the same thing as the Petya's program, and consists of no more than 5 lines. Your program should return the same integer as Petya's program for all arguments from 0 to 1023.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=5·105) — the number of lines.\n\nNext *n* lines contain commands. A command consists of a character that represents the operation (\"&amp;\", \"|\" or \"^\" for AND, OR or XOR respectively), and the constant *x**i* 0<=≤<=*x**i*<=≤<=1023.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput an integer *k* (0<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=5) — the length of your program.\n\nNext *k* lines must contain commands in the same format as in the input.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n| 3\\n^ 2\\n| 1\\n', '3\\n&amp; 1\\n&amp; 3\\n&amp; 5\\n', '3\\n^ 1\\n^ 2\\n^ 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n| 3\\n^ 2\\n', '1\\n&amp; 1\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nYou can read about bitwise operations in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation).\n\nSecond sample:\n\nLet *x* be an input of the Petya's program. It's output is ((*x*&amp;1)&amp;3)&amp;5 = *x*&amp;(1&amp;3&amp;5) = *x*&amp;1. So these two programs always give the same outputs.",
