  "prompt": "Title: Success Rate\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nYou are an experienced Codeforces user. Today you found out that during your activity on Codeforces you have made *y* submissions, out of which *x* have been successful. Thus, your current success rate on Codeforces is equal to *x*<=/<=*y*.\n\nYour favorite rational number in the [0;1] range is *p*<=/<=*q*. Now you wonder: what is the smallest number of submissions you have to make if you want your success rate to be *p*<=/<=*q*?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *t* (1<=≤<=*t*<=≤<=1000) — the number of test cases.\n\nEach of the next *t* lines contains four integers *x*, *y*, *p* and *q* (0<=≤<=*x*<=≤<=*y*<=≤<=109; 0<=≤<=*p*<=≤<=*q*<=≤<=109; *y*<=&gt;<=0; *q*<=&gt;<=0).\n\nIt is guaranteed that *p*<=/<=*q* is an irreducible fraction.\n\nHacks. For hacks, an additional constraint of *t*<=≤<=5 must be met.\n\nOutput Specification:\nFor each test case, output a single integer equal to the smallest number of submissions you have to make if you want your success rate to be equal to your favorite rational number, or -1 if this is impossible to achieve.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n3 10 1 2\\n7 14 3 8\\n20 70 2 7\\n5 6 1 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4\\n10\\n0\\n-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example, you have to make 4 successful submissions. Your success rate will be equal to 7 / 14, or 1 / 2.\n\nIn the second example, you have to make 2 successful and 8 unsuccessful submissions. Your success rate will be equal to 9 / 24, or 3 / 8.\n\nIn the third example, there is no need to make any new submissions. Your success rate is already equal to 20 / 70, or 2 / 7.\n\nIn the fourth example, the only unsuccessful submission breaks your hopes of having the success rate equal to 1.",
