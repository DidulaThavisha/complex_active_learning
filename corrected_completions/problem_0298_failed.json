  "prompt": "Title: Parity Game\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nYou are fishing with polar bears Alice and Bob. While waiting for the fish to bite, the polar bears get bored. They come up with a game. First Alice and Bob each writes a 01-string (strings that only contain character \"0\" and \"1\") *a* and *b*. Then you try to turn *a* into *b* using two types of operations:\n -  Write *parity*(*a*) to the end of *a*. For example, . -  Remove the first character of *a*. For example, . You cannot perform this operation if *a* is empty. \nYou can use as many operations as you want. The problem is, is it possible to turn *a* into *b*?\n\nThe *parity* of a 01-string is 1 if there is an odd number of \"1\"s in the string, and 0 otherwise.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains the string *a* and the second line contains the string *b* (1<=≤<=|*a*|,<=|*b*|<=≤<=1000). Both strings contain only the characters \"0\" and \"1\". Here |*x*| denotes the length of the string *x*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible to turn *a* into *b*, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nDemo Input:\n['01011\\n0110\\n', '0011\\n1110\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, the steps are as follows: 01011 → 1011 → 011 → 0110",
