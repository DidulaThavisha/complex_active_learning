You want to find a simple subset of the array *a* with the maximum size.\n\nA prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nLet's define a subset of the array *a* as a tuple that can be obtained from *a* by removing some (possibly all) elements of it.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=1000) — the number of integers in the array *a*.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a**i* (1<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=106) — the elements of the array *a*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOn the first line print integer *m* — the maximum possible size of simple subset of *a*.\n\nOn the second line print *m* integers *b**l* — the elements of the simple subset of the array *a* with the maximum size.\n\nIf there is more than one solution you can print any of them. You can print the elements of the subset in any order.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2\\n2 3\\n', '2\\n2 2\\n', '3\\n2 1 1\\n', '2\\n83 14\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n3 2\\n', '1\\n2\\n', '3\\n1 1 2\\n', '2\\n14 83\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
