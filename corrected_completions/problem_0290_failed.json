  "prompt": "Title: Black-and-White Cube\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nYou are given a cube of size *k*<=×<=*k*<=×<=*k*, which consists of unit cubes. Two unit cubes are considered neighbouring, if they have common face.\n\nYour task is to paint each of *k*3 unit cubes one of two colours (black or white), so that the following conditions must be satisfied:\n -  each white cube has exactly 2 neighbouring cubes of white color; -  each black cube has exactly 2 neighbouring cubes of black color.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *k* (1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=100), which is size of the cube.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint -1 if there is no solution. Otherwise, print the required painting of the cube consequently by layers. Print a *k*<=×<=*k* matrix in the first *k* lines, showing how the first layer of the cube should be painted. In the following *k* lines print a *k*<=×<=*k* matrix — the way the second layer should be painted. And so on to the last *k*-th layer. Note that orientation of the cube in the space does not matter.\n\nMark a white unit cube with symbol \"w\" and a black one with \"b\". Use the format of output data, given in the test samples. You may print extra empty lines, they will be ignored.\n\nDemo Input:\n['1\\n', '2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['-1\\n', 'bb\\nww\\n\\nbb\\nww\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
