  "prompt": "Title: Tablecity\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThere was a big bank robbery in Tablecity. In order to catch the thief, the President called none other than Albert – Tablecity’s Chief of Police. Albert does not know where the thief is located, but he does know how he moves.\n\nTablecity can be represented as 1000<=×<=2 grid, where every cell represents one district. Each district has its own unique name “(*X*,<=*Y*)”, where *X* and *Y* are the coordinates of the district in the grid. The thief’s movement is as \n\nEvery hour the thief will leave the district (*X*,<=*Y*) he is currently hiding in, and move to one of the districts: (*X*<=-<=1,<=*Y*), (*X*<=+<=1,<=*Y*), (*X*<=-<=1,<=*Y*<=-<=1), (*X*<=-<=1,<=*Y*<=+<=1), (*X*<=+<=1,<=*Y*<=-<=1), (*X*<=+<=1,<=*Y*<=+<=1) as long as it exists in Tablecity. \n\nBelow is an example of thief’s possible movements if he is located in district (7,1):\n\n\n\nAlbert has enough people so that every hour he can pick any two districts in Tablecity and fully investigate them, making sure that if the thief is located in one of them, he will get caught. Albert promised the President that the thief will be caught in no more than 2015 hours and needs your help in order to achieve that.\n\nInput Specification:\nThere is no input for this problem.\n\nOutput Specification:\nThe first line of output contains integer *N* – duration of police search in hours. Each of the following *N* lines contains exactly 4 integers *X**i*1, *Y**i*1, *X**i*2, *Y**i*2 separated by spaces, that represent 2 districts (*X**i*1, *Y**i*1), (*X**i*2, *Y**i*2) which got investigated during i-th hour. Output is given in chronological order (i-th line contains districts investigated during i-th hour) and should guarantee that the thief is caught in no more than 2015 hours, regardless of thief’s initial position and movement.\n -  *N*<=≤<=2015 -  1<=≤<=*X*<=≤<=1000 -  1<=≤<=*Y*<=≤<=2\n\nDemo Input:\n[\"В этой задаче нет примеров ввода-вывода.\\nThis problem doesn't have sample input and output.\"]\n\nDemo Output:\n['Смотрите замечание ниже.\\nSee the note below.']\n\nNote:\nLet's consider the following output:\n\n2\n\n5 1 50 2\n\n8 1 80 2\n\nThis output is not guaranteed to catch the thief and is not correct. It is given to you only to show the expected output format. There exists a combination of an initial position and a movement strategy such that the police will not catch the thief.\n\nConsider the following initial position and thief’s movement:\n\nIn the first hour, the thief is located in district (1,1). Police officers will search districts (5,1) and (50,2) and will not find him.\n\nAt the start of the second hour, the thief moves to district (2,2). Police officers will search districts (8,1) and (80,2) and will not find him.\n\nSince there is no further investigation by the police, the thief escaped!",
