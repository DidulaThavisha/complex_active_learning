  "prompt": "Title: Marina and Vasya\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nMarina loves strings of the same length and Vasya loves when there is a third string, different from them in exactly *t* characters. Help Vasya find at least one such string.\n\nMore formally, you are given two strings *s*1, *s*2 of length *n* and number *t*. Let's denote as *f*(*a*,<=*b*) the number of characters in which strings *a* and *b* are different. Then your task will be to find any string *s*3 of length *n*, such that *f*(*s*1,<=*s*3)<==<=*f*(*s*2,<=*s*3)<==<=*t*. If there is no such string, print <=-<=1.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *t* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105, 0<=≤<=*t*<=≤<=*n*).\n\nThe second line contains string *s*1 of length *n*, consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nThe third line contain string *s*2 of length *n*, consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a string of length *n*, differing from string *s*1 and from *s*2 in exactly *t* characters. Your string should consist only from lowercase English letters. If such string doesn't exist, print -1.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 2\\nabc\\nxyc\\n', '1 0\\nc\\nb\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['ayd', '-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
