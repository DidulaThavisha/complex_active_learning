  "prompt": "Title: Message\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nDr. Moriarty is about to send a message to Sherlock Holmes. He has a string *s*. \n\nString *p* is called a substring of string *s* if you can read it starting from some position in the string *s*. For example, string \"aba\" has six substrings: \"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aba\".\n\nDr. Moriarty plans to take string *s* and cut out some substring from it, let's call it *t*. Then he needs to change the substring *t* zero or more times. As a result, he should obtain a fixed string *u* (which is the string that should be sent to Sherlock Holmes). One change is defined as making one of the following actions: \n -  Insert one letter to any end of the string. -  Delete one letter from any end of the string. -  Change one letter into any other one. \nMoriarty is very smart and after he chooses some substring *t*, he always makes the minimal number of changes to obtain *u*. \n\nHelp Moriarty choose the best substring *t* from all substrings of the string *s*. The substring *t* should minimize the number of changes Moriarty should make to obtain the string *u* from it.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a non-empty string *s*, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The second line contains a non-empty string *u*, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The lengths of both strings are in the range from 1 to 2000, inclusive.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the only integer — the minimum number of changes that Dr. Moriarty has to make with the string that you choose.\n\nDemo Input:\n['aaaaa\\naaa\\n', 'abcabc\\nbcd\\n', 'abcdef\\nklmnopq\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0\\n', '1\\n', '7\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample Moriarty can take any substring of length 3, and it will be equal to the required message *u*, so Moriarty won't have to make any changes.\n\nIn the second sample you should take a substring consisting of characters from second to fourth (\"bca\") or from fifth to sixth (\"bc\"). Then you will only have to make one change: to change or to add the last character.\n\nIn the third sample the initial string *s* doesn't contain any character that the message should contain, so, whatever string you choose, you will have to make at least 7 changes to obtain the required message.",
