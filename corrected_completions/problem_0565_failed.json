  "prompt": "Title: Merge Sort\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nMerge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=≤<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=≤<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* — *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100000, 1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=200000) — the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf a permutation of size *n* such that there will be exactly *k* calls of *mergesort* while sorting it doesn't exist, output <=-<=1. Otherwise output *n* integer numbers *a*[0],<=*a*[1],<=...,<=*a*[*n*<=-<=1] — the elements of a permutation that would meet the required conditions. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 3\\n', '4 1\\n', '5 6\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2 1 3 ', '1 2 3 4 ', '-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
