  "prompt": "Title: k-Tree\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nQuite recently a creative student Lesha had a lecture on trees. After the lecture Lesha was inspired and came up with the tree of his own which he called a *k*-tree.\n\nA *k*-tree is an infinite rooted tree where:\n -  each vertex has exactly *k* children; -  each edge has some weight; -  if we look at the edges that goes from some vertex to its children (exactly *k* edges), then their weights will equal 1,<=2,<=3,<=...,<=*k*. \nThe picture below shows a part of a 3-tree.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHelp Dima find an answer to his question. As the number of ways can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\n\nInput Specification:\nA single line contains three space-separated integers: *n*, *k* and *d* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*k*<=≤<=100; 1<=≤<=*d*<=≤<=*k*).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 3 2\\n', '3 3 3\\n', '4 3 2\\n', '4 5 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n', '1\\n', '6\\n', '7\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
