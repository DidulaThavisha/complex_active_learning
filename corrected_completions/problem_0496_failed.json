  "prompt": "Title: Cutting Figure\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nYou've gotten an *n*<=×<=*m* sheet of squared paper. Some of its squares are painted. Let's mark the set of all painted squares as *A*. Set *A* is connected. Your task is to find the minimum number of squares that we can delete from set *A* to make it not connected.\n\nA set of painted squares is called connected, if for every two squares *a* and *b* from this set there is a sequence of squares from the set, beginning in *a* and ending in *b*, such that in this sequence any square, except for the last one, shares a common side with the square that follows next in the sequence. An empty set and a set consisting of exactly one square are connected by definition.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=50) — the sizes of the sheet of paper. \n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains *m* characters — the description of the sheet of paper: the *j*-th character of the *i*-th line equals either \"#\", if the corresponding square is painted (belongs to set *A*), or equals \".\" if the corresponding square is not painted (does not belong to set *A*). It is guaranteed that the set of all painted squares *A* is connected and isn't empty.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOn the first line print the minimum number of squares that need to be deleted to make set *A* not connected. If it is impossible, print -1.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 4\\n####\\n#..#\\n#..#\\n#..#\\n####\\n', '5 5\\n#####\\n#...#\\n#####\\n#...#\\n#####\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '2\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample you can delete any two squares that do not share a side. After that the set of painted squares is not connected anymore.\n\nThe note to the second sample is shown on the figure below. To the left there is a picture of the initial set of squares. To the right there is a set with deleted squares. The deleted squares are marked with crosses.",
