  "prompt": "Title: Rebus\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nYou are given a rebus of form ? + ? - ? + ? = n, consisting of only question marks, separated by arithmetic operation '+' and '-', equality and positive integer *n*. The goal is to replace each question mark with some positive integer from 1 to *n*, such that equality holds.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe only line of the input contains a rebus. It's guaranteed that it contains no more than 100 question marks, integer *n* is positive and doesn't exceed 1<=000<=000, all letters and integers are separated by spaces, arithmetic operations are located only between question marks.\n\nOutput Specification:\nThe first line of the output should contain \"Possible\" (without quotes) if rebus has a solution and \"Impossible\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nIf the answer exists, the second line should contain any valid rebus with question marks replaced by integers from 1 to *n*. Follow the format given in the samples.\n\nDemo Input:\n['? + ? - ? + ? + ? = 42\\n', '? - ? = 1\\n', '? = 1000000\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['Possible\\n9 + 13 - 39 + 28 + 31 = 42\\n', 'Impossible\\n', 'Possible\\n1000000 = 1000000\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
