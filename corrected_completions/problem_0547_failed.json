  "prompt": "Title: Palindromic Cut\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nKolya has a string *s* of length *n* consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and digits.\n\nHe wants to rearrange the symbols in *s* and cut it into the minimum number of parts so that each part is a palindrome and all parts have the same lengths. A palindrome is a string which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar.\n\nYour task is to help Kolya and determine the minimum number of palindromes of equal lengths to cut *s* into, if it is allowed to rearrange letters in *s* before cuttings.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=4·105) — the length of string *s*.\n\nThe second line contains a string *s* of length *n* consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and digits.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint to the first line an integer *k* — minimum number of palindromes into which you can cut a given string.\n\nPrint to the second line *k* strings — the palindromes themselves. Separate them by a space. You are allowed to print palindromes in arbitrary order. All of them should have the same length.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6\\naabaac\\n', '8\\n0rTrT022\\n', '2\\naA\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\naba aca ', '1\\n02TrrT20 ', '2\\na A \\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
