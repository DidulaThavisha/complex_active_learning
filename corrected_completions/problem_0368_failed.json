  "prompt": "Title: Five Dimensional Points\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nYou are given set of *n* points in 5-dimensional space. The points are labeled from 1 to *n*. No two points coincide.\n\nWe will call point *a* bad if there are different points *b* and *c*, not equal to *a*, from the given set such that angle between vectors  and  is acute (i.e. strictly less than ). Otherwise, the point is called good.\n\nThe angle between vectors  and  in 5-dimensional space is defined as , where  is the scalar product and  is length of .\n\nGiven the list of points, print the indices of the good points in ascending order.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains a single integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=103) — the number of points.\n\nThe next *n* lines of input contain five integers *a**i*,<=*b**i*,<=*c**i*,<=*d**i*,<=*e**i* (|*a**i*|,<=|*b**i*|,<=|*c**i*|,<=|*d**i*|,<=|*e**i*|<=≤<=103)  — the coordinates of the i-th point. All points are distinct.\n\nOutput Specification:\nFirst, print a single integer *k* — the number of good points.\n\nThen, print *k* integers, each on their own line — the indices of the good points in ascending order.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n1 0 0 0 0\\n0 1 0 0 0\\n0 0 1 0 0\\n0 0 0 1 0\\n0 0 0 0 1\\n', '3\\n0 0 1 2 0\\n0 0 9 2 0\\n0 0 5 9 0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n1\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, the first point forms exactly a <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/362ac8c7a7496dffc06cd0c843287cd822be63c3.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> angle with all other pairs of points, so it is good.\n\nIn the second sample, along the cd plane, we can see the points look as follows:\n\n<img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/982219f7eb73ea120de10dd91baa59317fe7af64.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\nWe can see that all angles here are acute, so no points are good.",
