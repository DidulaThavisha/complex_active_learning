  "prompt": "Title: LionAge II\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nVasya plays the LionAge II. He was bored of playing with a stupid computer, so he installed this popular MMORPG, to fight with his friends. Vasya came up with the name of his character — non-empty string *s*, consisting of a lowercase Latin letters. However, in order not to put up a front of friends, Vasya has decided to change no more than *k* letters of the character name so that the new name sounded as good as possible. Euphony of the line is defined as follows: for each pair of adjacent letters *x* and *y* (*x* immediately precedes *y*) the bonus *c*(*x*,<=*y*) is added to the result. Your task is to determine what the greatest Euphony can be obtained by changing at most *k* letters in the name of the Vasya's character.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains character's name *s* and an integer number *k* (0<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=100). The length of the nonempty string *s* does not exceed 100. The second line contains an integer number *n* (0<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=676) — amount of pairs of letters, giving bonus to the euphony. The next *n* lines contain description of these pairs «*x* *y* *c*», which means that sequence *xy* gives bonus *c* (*x*,<=*y* — lowercase Latin letters, <=-<=1000<=≤<=*c*<=≤<=1000). It is guaranteed that no pair *x* *y* mentioned twice in the input data.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput the only number — maximum possible euphony оf the new character's name.\n\nDemo Input:\n['winner 4\\n4\\ns e 7\\no s 8\\nl o 13\\no o 8\\n', 'abcdef 1\\n5\\na b -10\\nb c 5\\nc d 5\\nd e 5\\ne f 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['36', '20']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example the most euphony name will be *looser*. It is easy to calculate that its euphony is 36.",
