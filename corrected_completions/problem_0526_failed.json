  "prompt": "Title: Caesar's Legions\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nGaius Julius Caesar, a famous general, loved to line up his soldiers. Overall the army had *n*1 footmen and *n*2 horsemen. Caesar thought that an arrangement is not beautiful if somewhere in the line there are strictly more that *k*1 footmen standing successively one after another, or there are strictly more than *k*2 horsemen standing successively one after another. Find the number of beautiful arrangements of the soldiers. \n\nNote that all *n*1<=+<=*n*2 warriors should be present at each arrangement. All footmen are considered indistinguishable among themselves. Similarly, all horsemen are considered indistinguishable among themselves.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe only line contains four space-separated integers *n*1, *n*2, *k*1, *k*2 (1<=≤<=*n*1,<=*n*2<=≤<=100,<=1<=≤<=*k*1,<=*k*2<=≤<=10) which represent how many footmen and horsemen there are and the largest acceptable number of footmen and horsemen standing in succession, correspondingly.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the number of beautiful arrangements of the army modulo 100000000 (108). That is, print the number of such ways to line up the soldiers, that no more than *k*1 footmen stand successively, and no more than *k*2 horsemen stand successively.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 1 1 10\\n', '2 3 1 2\\n', '2 4 1 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '5\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nLet's mark a footman as 1, and a horseman as 2.\n\nIn the first sample the only beautiful line-up is: 121\n\nIn the second sample 5 beautiful line-ups exist: 12122, 12212, 21212, 21221, 22121",
