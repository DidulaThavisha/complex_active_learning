  "prompt": "Title: Table Decorations\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nYou have *r* red, *g* green and *b* blue balloons. To decorate a single table for the banquet you need exactly three balloons. Three balloons attached to some table shouldn't have the same color. What maximum number *t* of tables can be decorated if we know number of balloons of each color?\n\nYour task is to write a program that for given values *r*, *g* and *b* will find the maximum number *t* of tables, that can be decorated in the required manner.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe single line contains three integers *r*, *g* and *b* (0<=≤<=*r*,<=*g*,<=*b*<=≤<=2·109) — the number of red, green and blue baloons respectively. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer *t* — the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 4 3\\n', '1 1 1\\n', '2 3 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4\\n', '1\\n', '2\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample you can decorate the tables with the following balloon sets: \"rgg\", \"gbb\", \"brr\", \"rrg\", where \"r\", \"g\" and \"b\" represent the red, green and blue balls, respectively.",
