  "prompt": "Title: Making Sequences is Fun\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nWe'll define *S*(*n*) for positive integer *n* as follows: the number of the *n*'s digits in the decimal base. For example, *S*(893)<==<=3, *S*(114514)<==<=6.\n\nYou want to make a consecutive integer sequence starting from number *m* (*m*,<=*m*<=+<=1,<=...). But you need to pay *S*(*n*)·*k* to add the number *n* to the sequence.\n\nYou can spend a cost up to *w*, and you want to make the sequence as long as possible. Write a program that tells sequence's maximum length.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *w* (1<=≤<=*w*<=≤<=1016), *m* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=1016), *k* (1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=109).\n\nPlease, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\nOutput Specification:\nThe first line should contain a single integer — the answer to the problem.\n\nDemo Input:\n['9 1 1\\n', '77 7 7\\n', '114 5 14\\n', '1 1 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['9\\n', '7\\n', '6\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
