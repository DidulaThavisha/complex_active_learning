  "prompt": "Title: Maximum Xor Secondary\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nBike loves looking for the second maximum element in the sequence. The second maximum element in the sequence of distinct numbers *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**k* (*k*<=&gt;<=1) is such maximum element *x**j*, that the following inequality holds: .\n\nThe lucky number of the sequence of distinct positive integers *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**k* (*k*<=&gt;<=1) is the number that is equal to the bitwise excluding OR of the maximum element of the sequence and the second maximum element of the sequence.\n\nYou've got a sequence of distinct positive integers *s*1,<=*s*2,<=...,<=*s**n* (*n*<=&gt;<=1). Let's denote sequence *s**l*,<=*s**l*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*s**r* as *s*[*l*..*r*] (1<=≤<=*l*<=&lt;<=*r*<=≤<=*n*). Your task is to find the maximum number among all lucky numbers of sequences *s*[*l*..*r*].\n\nNote that as all numbers in sequence *s* are distinct, all the given definitions make sence.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (1<=&lt;<=*n*<=≤<=105). The second line contains *n* distinct integers *s*1,<=*s*2,<=...,<=*s**n* (1<=≤<=*s**i*<=≤<=109).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer — the maximum lucky number among all lucky numbers of sequences *s*[*l*..*r*].\n\nDemo Input:\n['5\\n5 2 1 4 3\\n', '5\\n9 8 3 5 7\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['7\\n', '15\\n']\n\nNote:\nFor the first sample you can choose *s*[4..5] = {4, 3} and its lucky number is (4 *xor* 3) = 7. You can also choose *s*[1..2].\n\nFor the second sample you must choose *s*[2..5] = {8, 3, 5, 7}.",
