  "prompt": "Title: Writing Code\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nProgrammers working on a large project have just received a task to write exactly *m* lines of code. There are *n* programmers working on a project, the *i*-th of them makes exactly *a**i* bugs in every line of code that he writes. \n\nLet's call a sequence of non-negative integers *v*1,<=*v*2,<=...,<=*v**n* a plan, if *v*1<=+<=*v*2<=+<=...<=+<=*v**n*<==<=*m*. The programmers follow the plan like that: in the beginning the first programmer writes the first *v*1 lines of the given task, then the second programmer writes *v*2 more lines of the given task, and so on. In the end, the last programmer writes the remaining lines of the code. Let's call a plan good, if all the written lines of the task contain at most *b* bugs in total.\n\nYour task is to determine how many distinct good plans are there. As the number of plans can be large, print the remainder of this number modulo given positive integer *mod*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains four integers *n*, *m*, *b*, *mod* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=500, 0<=≤<=*b*<=≤<=500; 1<=≤<=*mod*<=≤<=109<=+<=7) — the number of programmers, the number of lines of code in the task, the maximum total number of bugs respectively and the modulo you should use when printing the answer.\n\nThe next line contains *n* space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=500) — the number of bugs per line for each programmer.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo *mod*.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 3 3 100\\n1 1 1\\n', '3 6 5 1000000007\\n1 2 3\\n', '3 5 6 11\\n1 2 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['10\\n', '0\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
