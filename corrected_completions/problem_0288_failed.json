In the second line print *m* distinct integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m*. Each printed integer should be a *k*-bonacci number. The sum of printed integers must equal *s*.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are several possible answers, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 2\\n', '21 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n0 2 3\\n', '3\\n4 1 16\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
