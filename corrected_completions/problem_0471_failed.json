  "prompt": "Title: Long Path\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOne day, little Vasya found himself in a maze consisting of (*n*<=+<=1) rooms, numbered from 1 to (*n*<=+<=1). Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out of the maze, he needs to get to the (*n*<=+<=1)-th one.\n\nThe maze is organized as follows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let's consider room number *i* (1<=≤<=*i*<=≤<=*n*), someone can use the first portal to move from it to room number (*i*<=+<=1), also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room number *p**i*, where 1<=≤<=*p**i*<=≤<=*i*.\n\nIn order not to get lost, Vasya decided to act as follows. \n -  Each time Vasya enters some room, he paints a cross on its ceiling. Initially, Vasya paints a cross at the ceiling of room 1. -  Let's assume that Vasya is in room *i* and has already painted a cross on its ceiling. Then, if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses, Vasya uses the second portal (it leads to room *p**i*), otherwise Vasya uses the first portal. \nHelp Vasya determine the number of times he needs to use portals to get to room (*n*<=+<=1) in the end.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=103) — the number of rooms. The second line contains *n* integers *p**i* (1<=≤<=*p**i*<=≤<=*i*). Each *p**i* denotes the number of the room, that someone can reach, if he will use the second portal in the *i*-th room.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number — the number of portal moves the boy needs to go out of the maze. As the number can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\n\nDemo Input:\n['2\\n1 2\\n', '4\\n1 1 2 3\\n', '5\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4\\n', '20\\n', '62\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
