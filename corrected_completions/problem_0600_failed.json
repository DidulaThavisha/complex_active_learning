  "prompt": "Title: Star sky\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe Cartesian coordinate system is set in the sky. There you can see *n* stars, the *i*-th has coordinates (*x**i*, *y**i*), a maximum brightness *c*, equal for all stars, and an initial brightness *s**i* (0<=≤<=*s**i*<=≤<=*c*).\n\nOver time the stars twinkle. At moment 0 the *i*-th star has brightness *s**i*. Let at moment *t* some star has brightness *x*. Then at moment (*t*<=+<=1) this star will have brightness *x*<=+<=1, if *x*<=+<=1<=≤<=*c*, and 0, otherwise.\n\nYou want to look at the sky *q* times. In the *i*-th time you will look at the moment *t**i* and you will see a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the lower left corner has coordinates (*x*1*i*, *y*1*i*) and the upper right — (*x*2*i*, *y*2*i*). For each view, you want to know the total brightness of the stars lying in the viewed rectangle.\n\nA star lies in a rectangle if it lies on its border or lies strictly inside it.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *q*, *c* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*q*<=≤<=105, 1<=≤<=*c*<=≤<=10) — the number of the stars, the number of the views and the maximum brightness of the stars.\n\nThe next *n* lines contain the stars description. The *i*-th from these lines contains three integers *x**i*, *y**i*, *s**i* (1<=≤<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=≤<=100, 0<=≤<=*s**i*<=≤<=*c*<=≤<=10) — the coordinates of *i*-th star and its initial brightness.\n\nThe next *q* lines contain the views description. The *i*-th from these lines contains five integers *t**i*, *x*1*i*, *y*1*i*, *x*2*i*, *y*2*i* (0<=≤<=*t**i*<=≤<=109, 1<=≤<=*x*1*i*<=&lt;<=*x*2*i*<=≤<=100, 1<=≤<=*y*1*i*<=&lt;<=*y*2*i*<=≤<=100) — the moment of the *i*-th view and the coordinates of the viewed rectangle.\n\nOutput Specification:\nFor each view print the total brightness of the viewed stars.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n3 2 0\\n2 1 1 2 2\\n0 2 1 4 5\\n5 1 1 5 5\\n', '3 4 5\\n1 1 2\\n2 3 0\\n3 3 1\\n0 1 1 100 100\\n1 2 2 4 4\\n2 2 1 4 7\\n1 50 50 51 51\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n0\\n3\\n', '3\\n3\\n5\\n0\\n']\n\nNote:\nLet's consider the first example.\n\nAt the first view, you can see only the first star. At moment 2 its brightness is 3, so the answer is 3.\n\nAt the second view, you can see only the second star. At moment 0 its brightness is 0, so the answer is 0.\n\nAt the third view, you can see both stars. At moment 5 brightness of the first is 2, and brightness of the second is 1, so the answer is 3.",
