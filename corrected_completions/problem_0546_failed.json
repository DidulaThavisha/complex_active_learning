  "prompt": "Title: Fish Weight\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIt is known that there are *k* fish species in the polar ocean, numbered from 1 to *k*. They are sorted by non-decreasing order of their weight, which is a positive number. Let the weight of the *i*-th type of fish be *w**i*, then 0<=&lt;<=*w*1<=≤<=*w*2<=≤<=...<=≤<=*w**k* holds.\n\nPolar bears Alice and Bob each have caught some fish, and they are guessing who has the larger sum of weight of the fish he/she's caught. Given the type of the fish they've caught, determine whether it is possible that the fish caught by Alice has a strictly larger total weight than Bob's. In other words, does there exist a sequence of weights *w**i* (not necessary integers), such that the fish caught by Alice has a strictly larger total weight?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*k* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=105,<=1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=109) — the number of fish caught by Alice and Bob respectively, and the number of fish species.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers each from 1 to *k*, the list of fish type caught by Alice. The third line contains *m* integers each from 1 to *k*, the list of fish type caught by Bob.\n\nNote that one may have caught more than one fish for a same species.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 3 3\\n2 2 2\\n1 1 3\\n', '4 7 9\\n5 2 7 3\\n3 5 2 7 3 8 7\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, if *w*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub> = 1, *w*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub> = 2, *w*<sub class=\"lower-index\">3</sub> = 2.5,  then Alice has a total of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 weight units, while Bob only has 1 + 1 + 2.5 = 4.5.\n\nIn the second sample, the fish that Alice caught is a subset of Bob's. Therefore, the total weight of Bob’s fish is always not less than the total weight of Alice’s fish.",
