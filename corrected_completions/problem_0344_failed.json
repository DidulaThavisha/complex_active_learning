  "prompt": "Title: Magic Formulas\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nPeople in the Tomskaya region like magic formulas very much. You can see some of them below.\n\nImagine you are given a sequence of positive integer numbers *p*1, *p*2, ..., *p**n*. Lets write down some magic formulas:\n\nHere, \"mod\" means the operation of taking the residue after dividing.\n\nThe expression  means applying the bitwise *xor* (excluding \"OR\") operation to integers *x* and *y*. The given operation exists in all modern programming languages. For example, in languages C++ and Java it is represented by \"^\", in Pascal — by \"xor\".\n\nPeople in the Tomskaya region like magic formulas very much, but they don't like to calculate them! Therefore you are given the sequence *p*, calculate the value of *Q*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains the only integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=106). The next line contains *n* integers: *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* (0<=≤<=*p**i*<=≤<=2·109).\n\nOutput Specification:\nThe only line of output should contain a single integer — the value of *Q*.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n1 2 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
