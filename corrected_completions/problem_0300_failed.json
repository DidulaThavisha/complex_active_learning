  "prompt": "Title: Bracket Sequence\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nA bracket sequence is a string, containing only characters \"(\", \")\", \"[\" and \"]\".\n\nA correct bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \"1\" and \"+\" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences \"()[]\", \"([])\" are correct (the resulting expressions are: \"(1)+[1]\", \"([1+1]+1)\"), and \"](\" and \"[\" are not. The empty string is a correct bracket sequence by definition.\n\nA substring *s*[*l*... *r*] (1<=≤<=*l*<=≤<=*r*<=≤<=|*s*|) of string *s*<==<=*s*1*s*2... *s*|*s*| (where |*s*| is the length of string *s*) is the string *s**l**s**l*<=+<=1... *s**r*. The empty string is a substring of any string by definition.\n\nYou are given a bracket sequence, not necessarily correct. Find its substring which is a correct bracket sequence and contains as many opening square brackets «[» as possible.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first and the only line contains the bracket sequence as a string, consisting only of characters \"(\", \")\", \"[\" and \"]\". It is guaranteed that the string is non-empty and its length doesn't exceed 105 characters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print a single integer — the number of brackets «[» in the required bracket sequence. In the second line print the optimal sequence. If there are more than one optimal solutions print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['([])\\n', '(((\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n([])\\n', '0\\n\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
