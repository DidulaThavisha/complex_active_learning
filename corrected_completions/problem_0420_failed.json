  "prompt": "Title: Undoubtedly Lucky Numbers\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nPolycarpus loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers, whose decimal representation (without leading zeroes) contain only the lucky digits *x* and *y*. For example, if *x*<==<=4, and *y*<==<=7, then numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky.\n\nLet's call a positive integer *a* undoubtedly lucky, if there are such digits *x* and *y* (0<=≤<=*x*,<=*y*<=≤<=9), that the decimal representation of number *a* (without leading zeroes) contains only digits *x* and *y*.\n\nPolycarpus has integer *n*. He wants to know how many positive integers that do not exceed *n*, are undoubtedly lucky. Help him, count this number.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=109) — Polycarpus's number.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer that says, how many positive integers that do not exceed *n* are undoubtedly lucky.\n\nDemo Input:\n['10\\n', '123\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['10\\n', '113\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first test sample all numbers that do not exceed 10 are undoubtedly lucky.\n\nIn the second sample numbers 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 120, 123 are not undoubtedly lucky.",
