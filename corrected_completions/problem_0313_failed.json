  "prompt": "Title: Beauty Pageant\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nGeneral Payne has a battalion of *n* soldiers. The soldiers' beauty contest is coming up, it will last for *k* days. Payne decided that his battalion will participate in the pageant. Now he has choose the participants.\n\nAll soldiers in the battalion have different beauty that is represented by a positive integer. The value *a**i* represents the beauty of the *i*-th soldier.\n\nOn each of *k* days Generals has to send a detachment of soldiers to the pageant. The beauty of the detachment is the sum of the beauties of the soldiers, who are part of this detachment. Payne wants to surprise the jury of the beauty pageant, so each of *k* days the beauty of the sent detachment should be unique. In other words, all *k* beauties of the sent detachments must be distinct numbers.\n\nHelp Payne choose *k* detachments of different beauties for the pageant. Please note that Payne cannot just forget to send soldiers on one day, that is, the detachment of soldiers he sends to the pageant should never be empty.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n*, *k* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=50; 1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<= ) — the number of soldiers and the number of days in the pageant, correspondingly. The second line contains space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=107) — the beauties of the battalion soldiers.\n\nIt is guaranteed that Payne's battalion doesn't have two soldiers with the same beauty.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *k* lines: in the *i*-th line print the description of the detachment that will participate in the pageant on the *i*-th day. The description consists of integer *c**i* (1<=≤<=*c**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the number of soldiers in the detachment on the *i*-th day of the pageant and *c**i* distinct integers *p*1,<=*i*,<=*p*2,<=*i*,<=...,<=*p**c**i*,<=*i* — the beauties of the soldiers in the detachment on the *i*-th day of the pageant. The beauties of the soldiers are allowed to print in any order.\n\nSeparate numbers on the lines by spaces. It is guaranteed that there is the solution that meets the problem conditions. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 3\\n1 2 3\\n', '2 1\\n7 12\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1 1\\n1 2\\n2 3 2\\n', '1 12 \\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",
